      Your GCN client credential named "${cred.name}" has not been used recently and will expire in the next few days.

      For security purposes, we disable client credentials that you have not used to connect to a Kafka broker for the past 30 days. Once disabled, a client credential cannot be used again. To prevent a credential from expiring and being disabled, simply use it to connect to a Kafka broker. You may create new client credentials at any time. For more information on this policy, see our documentation at ${origin}/docs/faq#why-are-my-kafka-client-credentials-expiring.

      No actions are needed on your end. You can review your client credentials at ${origin}/user/credentials or visit ${origin}/contact for questions and support.
