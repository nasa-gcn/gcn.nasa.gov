// FIXME: A single AWS Lambda execution environment can handle multiple
// invocations; AWS sends the runtime SIGTERM when it is time to shut down.
// However, @architect/sandbox does not properly simulate this behavior when it
// invokes a Lambda; rather than returning control after the Lambda handler
// returns, @architect/sandbox hangs until the Node.js runtime process
// terminates, or a timeout is reached, and then apparently kills the runtime
// process ungracefully. This is a problem if there are resources that are
// initialized during the invocation that have unsettled promises in the
// background that keep the Node.js runtime's event loop going.
//
// On AWS Lambda, we leave the Kafka connection open so that it is reused over
// multiple invocations and we register a beforeExit event handler to close it
// when the runtime is gracefully shutting down. However, until the above issue
// is fixed in @architect/sandbox, we need a separate code path for local
// testing.
