# Subscribing to Circulars

Most users prefer to receive GCN Circulars by email. Automated systems may benefit from utilization of the Circulars Kafka stream.

## Receive Circulars by Email

<ProcessList>
  <ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListHeading type="h3">
      [Sign in / Sign up](/login)
    </ProcessListHeading>
    Sign up for GCN or sign in to your existing account by tapping the [Sign in / Sign up](/login) button in the navigation bar.

    <Alert headingLevel="h4" heading="Migrating from GCN Classic">
      If you were previously signed up to receive GCN Circulars via the legacy GCN Classic circulars service, your preferences were automatically transferred and you should already be subscribed already.

      Once you make an account here with the same email address, you will be able to modify your preferences.
    </Alert>

  </ProcessListItem>
  <ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListHeading type="h3">
      Go to [Email Notifications](/user/email) Settings
    </ProcessListHeading>
    Once you are signed in, open the user menu in the navigation bar and go to [Email Notifications](/user/email).
  </ProcessListItem>
  <ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListHeading type="h3">Turn your Subscription On or Off</ProcessListHeading>
    Toggle the "On/Off" button next to Circulars to enable or disable GCN Circulars by email.
  </ProcessListItem>
</ProcessList>

## Stream Circulars over Kafka

If you have an existing Kafka listener generated from the [Start Streaming GCN Notices interface](quickstart), simply add the Kafka topic `gcn.circulars`.

Alternatively, visit the [Start Streaming GCN Notices interface](quickstart), select JSON, and the Circulars topic.

Note that upon [corrections](corrections), all revised Circular versions will be distributed over the Kafka stream.
