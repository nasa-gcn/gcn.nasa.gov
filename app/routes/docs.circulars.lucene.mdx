# Lucene Search

The Circulars Archive now has a full-text search feature that allows for specifying the field a search term should match. The search feature uses the [Lucene query syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html) to specify the field and search term. The search feature supports the following fields:

- Subject: `subject`
- Body: `body`
- Submitter: `submitter`

By default, a query that does not contain lucene syntax will attempt to match the query against all 3 fields. For example, the query 'SWIFT' will match any circular that contains the word 'SWIFT' in the subject, body, or submitter fields, whereas the query 'subect:SWIFT' will only match circulars where the subject contains the word 'SWIFT'.
