**Launch Date:** As early as Jan 2026  
**Mission Duration:** ~1 year (with possible extension)

The **Black hole Coded Aperture Telescope (BlackCAT)** is a NASA-funded **6U CubeSat mission** led by **Pennsylvania State University**. BlackCAT is designed to monitor the **soft X-ray sky (0.5 - 20 keV)** with a wide field of view, enabling the rapid detection and localization of high-energy transients.

The primary science objective of BlackCAT is the discovery of **high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)**, which serve as probes of star formation, metal enrichment, and reionization in the early Universe. Sensitivity in the soft X-ray band provides an intrinsic advantage for detecting distant GRBs whose spectra are redshifted out of the gamma-ray regime. BlackCAT also functions as a wide field X-ray transient monitor, providing rapid alerts for multiwavelength and multimessenger follow-up.

The science instrument is designed, built, and calibrated by **Penn State**, while the spacecraft bus is provided by **Kongsberg NanoAvionics US**.

**JSON-Serialized GCN Notices Types in GCN Kafka**

BlackCAT will distribute alerts for gamma-ray bursts and other high energy X-ray transients via GCN Kafka. Mission-specific schemas and example JSON messages will be provided through the GCN Schema Browser and GitHub repository prior to operations.
