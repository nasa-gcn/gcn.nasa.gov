      </CollectionHeading>
      <CollectionDescription>
        - **Stream Circulars over Kafka in JSON format** on the topic `gcn.circulars`.  Add Circulars to your existing Kafka streaming codes or generated via the [Start Streaming GCN Notices interface](/quickstart).
        - **GCN Heartbeat Kafka Topic** (`gcn.heartbeat`) broadcasts a test message approximately once a second.
        - **Schema v4.1.0** includes the following updates:
          - [Circulars schema](https://gcn.nasa.gov/docs/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/circulars.schema.json).
          - `id` property (from the Event core schema) in [Einstein Probe Notices](https://gcn.nasa.gov/docs/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/notices/einstein_probe/wxt/alert.schema.json).
          - [Pointing core schema](https://gcn.nasa.gov/docs/schema/v4.1.0/gcn/notices/core/Pointing.schema.json) changed from `ra` and `dec` to `ra_pointing` and `dec_pointing` to remove ambiguity with source position.

        <Anchor>New Einstein Probe Notices, Astro Flavored Markdown for Circulars, and Notices Schema v4.0.0</Anchor>
      </CollectionHeading>
      <CollectionDescription>
        There are several new features and updates.  Please see below for details.

        - [Einstein Probe Notices](#einstein-probe-notices)
        - [Astro Flavored Markdown](#astro-flavored-markdown)
        - [Notices Schema v4.0.0](#notices-schema-v400)

        #### Einstein Probe Notices
          GCN Notices for Einstein Probe (EP) are now available in JSON format over [Kafka](/quickstart). EP notices are not available via GCN Classic or email.
          - Summary: EP is a mission of the [Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://ep.bao.ac.cn/ep/) in collaboration with the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/einstein-probe/mission) and the [Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/7867826/EinsteinProbe).  It is dedicated to time-domain high-energy astrophysics. Its primary goals are to discover high-energy transients and monitor variable objects.
          - Rate: Approximately 100 notices per year.
          - Time Delay: EP sends alerts via GCN within ~60 seconds of detection.
          - Notice Type: The [new WXT notice type (`gcn.notices.einstein_probe.wxt.alert`)](/missions/einstein-probe) provides trigger information including localization.
          - Notice Schema and Examples: The JSON schema defining the notice format and examples can be viewed in the [Schema Browser](/docs/schema/stable/gcn/notices/einstein_probe/wxt/alert.schema.json) or the GCN [schema repository](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-schema/tree/main/gcn/notices/einstein_probe/wxt).

        #### Astro Flavored Markdown
          You can now add rich text formatting, data tables, and references to journals and common astronomical databases to GCN Circulars using Astro Flavored Markdown, a dialect of the popular Markdown lightweight markup language. See [documentation on Astro Flavored Markdown](/docs/circulars/markdown).

        #### Notices Schema v4.0.0
        Explore GCN Schema via the [Schema Browser](/docs/schema/stable/gcn/notices).  Changes to the GCN Schema include:
          - Addition of Einstein Probe WXT Notice topic
          - Addition of BurstCube Notice topic (not yet producing notices)
          - Change to localization core schema that simplifies localization uncertainty parameterization (now `ra_dec_error`) to allow either a single radius or three values that describe the localization region as an ellipse.  This change is not backwards compatible.
          - Note that the `$schema` field in each GCN Notice identifies the version of the schema it is utilizing. [`gcn.notices.icecube.lvk_nu_track_search`](/docs/schema/stable/gcn/notices/icecube/lvk_nu_track_search.schema.json) will update on the morning of June 18, 2024, and [`gcn.notices.swift.bat.guano`](/docs/schema/stable/gcn/notices/swift/bat/Guano.schema.json) will be updated at a later date.

        <Anchor>New Swift-BAT/GUANO and IceCube Notices Available via GCN Kafka</Anchor>
      </CollectionHeading>
      <CollectionDescription>
        The Swift-BAT/GUANO, IceCube, and GCN teams are pleased to announce the availability of new GCN notice types via the new GCN in JSON format.  JSON format notices can be streamed via [Kafka](/quickstart). These new notice types are *not* available via GCN Classic.

        [**Swift-BAT/GUANO:**](/missions/swift#json-serialized-gcn-notice-types-in-gcn-kafka) gcn.notices.swift.bat.guano

        - *Summary:* GUANO is a ground-based analysis of data from Swift BAT, significantly enhancing the sensitivity and sky area covered as compared to Swift's onboard triggering.
        - *Occurence Rate:* The Swift/BAT-GUANO notices occur at a rate of 50 times per year.
        - *Time Delay:* The post-event processing and communication of alert is distributed to GCN within 10 minutes to 5 hours of detection, depending on data downlink method and space-to-ground communications resource availability.
        - *Notice Type:* The new [Swift/BAT-GUANO notice type](/missions/swift#json-serialized-gcn-notice-types-in-gcn-kafka) (gcn.notices.swift.bat.guano) provides timestamps, sky locations, durations, and other supplementary information on gamma-ray transients discovered through this system, to enable prompt follow-up by observers and other instruments.  The 'initial' notice distributed for any detection will not include localization information. In the majority of cases later 'update' notices will follow with a localization attached. ~1/4 of GUANO bursts will have arcminute-scale localizations, distributed in the form [RA, Dec, Error] the remainder will be more poorly localized and may be distributed as HEALPix maps.

        [**IceCube LVK Neutrino Track Search:**](/missions/icecube#gcn-notice-types-in-gcn-over-kafka) gcn.notices.icecube.lvk_nu_track_search
        - *Summary:* IceCube is a is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov particle detector deployed in the Antarctic ice beneath the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. IceCube detects neutrinos by observing the light produced by relativistic charged particles created by neutrino interactions in or near the instrumented volume of ice.
        - *Occurrence Rate:* The LVK Nu Track Search notices are triggered by [LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA alerts](/missions/lvk) and occur at the same rate of these alerts, searching for neutrino signals from both significant and low significance LVK alerts.
        - *Time Delay:* Neutrino searches are performed in a +/- 500 second time window about the LVK alert, and Nu Track search results are generally available within ~1000 seconds of the LVK GW event time.
        - *Notice Type:* The new [LVK Nu Track Search notice type](/missions/icecube#gcn-notice-types-in-gcn-over-kafka) (gcn.notices.icecube.lvk_nu_track_search) provides results from realtime searches for coincident neutrino signals from all LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational-wave alerts, using a realtime muon neutrino track-like event selection and the sky maps from gravitational wave detectors. Search results will include neutrino directions for observed coincident events with the aim to identify multi-messenger transient sources and seed electromagnetic followup up observations.

        *Notice Schema and Examples:* The JSON schema defining the notice format and examples can be viewed in the [Schema Browser](/docs/schema) or the [GCN schema repository](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-schema).

        <Anchor>Important notes for GCN Kafka client users</Anchor>
      </CollectionHeading>
      <CollectionDescription>
        Thanks to the feedback of some of our users, we have tracked down and fixed several reliability issues related to our Kafka brokers and clients. If you are consuming GCN Notices via Kafka in Python, then please take the actions noted below.

        * **Daily Kafka outages have been resolved.** The GCN Kafka brokers had been experiencing daily outages at around 00:00 UTC and lasting from about a minute to an hour. We traced the problem to a log collection agent that was using excessive memory. We resolved the issue by disabling the agent.
        * **Python sample code has been updated.** Our [Python client sample code](/docs/client#python) was missing some necessary error handling. Some errors that may occur in the `consumer.consume()` loop are reported in the returned Kafka message. If you consume GCN Notices via Kafka in Python using the [gcn-kafka-python](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-kafka-python) client or [confluent-kafka-python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python), then please be sure to update your code as follows.

          If your client consume loop looks like this:

          ```python
          while True:
              for message in consumer.consume(timeout=1):
                  value = message.value()
                  # add your code to process the alert here
          ```

          then add an `if` statement to skip normal processing for errors, like this:

          ```python
          while True:
              for message in consumer.consume(timeout=1):
                  if message.error():
                      print(message.error())
                      continue
                  value = message.value()
                  # add your code to process the alert here
          ```
        * **New version of Python client.** We have released version 0.3.3 of our [official Python client, gcn-kafka-python](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-kafka-python). This version improves the reliability of authentication for long-lived connections. Please update to the latest version. If you are not using our official client but you are using [confluent-kafka-python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) directly, then please update to the latest version of confluent-kafka-python (2.2.0 or newer).

      <CollectionDescription>
        We are pleased to announce that on April 17, 2023, the General Coordinates Network will launch the most significant overhaul of GCN Circulars since its inception in 1997. The modernized GCN Circulars experience will be part of the new GCN web site.
        After the transition on April 17, you will be able to:
        - Browse and search Circulars in our all-new [archive](/circulars).
        - Sign up for and manage your own email subscriptions.
        - Enroll yourself and your colleagues to submit Circulars with arXiv-style peer endorsements for new contributors.
        - Submit Circulars with our new Web form, or continue to submit by email.

        Here is what you need to know about preparing for the transition on April 17.
        - If you use Circulars now, we will transfer your settings automatically.
        - If you receive Circulars now, you will continue to receive them.
        - If you submit Circulars now, you will still be able to submit from the same email addresses.
        - Emails from Circulars will come from a new address, no-reply@gcn.nasa.gov.
        - We will encourage you to submit Circulars to the new address, circulars@gcn.nasa.gov, but we will still support the old address gcncirc@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov.
        - The [new archive](/circulars) will include all past Circulars. We will freeze the old archive,
          https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_archive.html.

        To introduce GCN users to the [new GCN Circular system](/circulars), we invite you to join one of our three public Zoom webinars:
