# Administration

This documentation is not relevant for most users. It is included because the source code is open to the public.

The admin pages allow authorized users to manage users' Kafka group settings.

## User Group Management

User groups are tied to which Kafka topics a given user can consume from or produce to. As part of making new mission adoption a smoother process, Admin users can modify which groups other users belong to.

Navigate to the [user admin page](/admin/users), search for the user whose group membership you want to update, then click the Edit button.

Update the user groups as appropriate then click save for the changes to take effect.
