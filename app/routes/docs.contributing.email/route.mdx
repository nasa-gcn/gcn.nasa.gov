# Email Data Flow

**Source code:** [app/email-incoming](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/tree/main/app/email-incoming)

Here we document the processing of incoming and outgoing emails in GCN using [Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). The source code for incoming email processing is in the [app/email-incoming](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/tree/main/app/email-incoming) directory.

Note that each flow chart represents the email processing for a single one of GCN's three [deployment stages](deployment#stages). In each diagram, replace _stage_.gcn.nasa.gov with gcn.nasa.gov for production, test.gcn.nasa.gov for testing, or dev.gcn.nasa.gov for development.

## Circulars Ingestion

**Source code:** [app/email-incoming/circulars](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/tree/main/app/email-incoming/circulars)

<img src={circularsIngestionImg} alt="Flow chart of GCN Circulars ingestion" />

Authorized GCN users can [submit GCN Circulars](/docs/circulars/submitting) in any one of three ways: by logging in and completing the [Web form](/circulars/new), by submitting an email to circulars@<i>stage</i>.gcn.nasa.gov, or by submitting an email to the legacy GCN Classic server at <span>gcncirc</span>@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov.

### By Web form

In order to submit a Circular via the Web form, the user must be signed in and must belong to the `circular-submitter` Cognito group. The subject of the Circular is validated against a list of [allowed and disallowed keywords](/docs/circulars/styleguide#message-content). If these checks pass, then the Circular is accepted, stored in the database, and distributed to GCN Circulars subscribers.

### By email to circulars@<i>stage</i>.gcn.nasa.gov

To submit a Circular via email, the user sends an email to circulars@<i>stage</i>.gcn.nasa.gov. When Amazon SES receives this message, it triggers a Lambda function whose source code is in [app/email-incoming/circulars](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/tree/main/app/email-incoming/circulars). The Lambda function does the following:

- A copy of the incoming email is saved in an S3 bucket.
- If the email did not pass Amazon SES's [spam and virus checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-concepts.html#receiving-email-auth-and-scan), then the Lambda function rejects it without further processing.
- Otherwise, the Lambda function checks that the From: address matches the email address of a user who belongs to the `circular-submitter` group.
- The Lambda checks that the subject validates against a list of [allowed and disallowed keywords](/docs/circulars/styleguide#message-content).
- If all of the above checks pass, then the Circular is accepted, stored in the database, and distributed to GCN Circulars subscribers.

### By email to <span>gcncirc</span>@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov

The legacy, on-premise GCN Classic server at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov, is configured to forward messages addressed to <span>gcncirc</span>@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov to <span>circulars</span>@gcn.nasa.gov. Once received by Amazon SES, processing proceeds the same as above.

## Support Requests

**Source code:** [app/email-incoming/support](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/tree/main/app/email-incoming/support)

_Important_: Zendesk ticketing is not yet implemented for GCN because we are waiting for our cloud engineering team to fix an S3 issue. See [nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov#1025](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/pull/1025).

<img src={forwardToZendeskImg} alt="Flow chart of support ticket ingestion" />

We use [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) for tracking user support requests. Users can submit support requests through our [contact form](/contact) or (soon) by sending an email to support@<i>stage</i>.gcn.nasa.gov.

We have configured support@<i>stage</i>.gcn.nasa.gov as an [external support address](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886828698) for Zendesk:

- A Lambda function whose source code is in the [app/email-incoming/support](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/tree/main/app/email-incoming/support) directory runs for each incoming email addressed to support@<i>stage</i>.gcn.nasa.gov.
- A copy of the incoming email is saved in an S3 bucket.
- If the email did not pass Amazon SES's [spam and virus checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-concepts.html#receiving-email-auth-and-scan), then the Lambda function rejects it without further processing.
- Otherwise, the Lambda function forwards the email to our Zendesk account's system address.

When a GCN team member responds to a ticket in the Zendesk console, Zendesk sends the email from support@<i>stage</i>.gcn.nasa.gov. The <i>stage</i>.gcn.nasa.gov domain has [SPF records to permit Zendesk to send emails from this address](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832543770) and to [DKIM records to have Zendisk digitally sign messages](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822303386-Digitally-signing-your-email-with-DKIM-or-DMARC).
