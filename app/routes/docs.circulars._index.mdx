# GCN Circulars

GCN Circulars are rapid astronomical bulletins submitted by and distributed to community members worldwide.

- Circulars are **brief**, **citeable**, and **human-readable**.
- Circulars can announce observations, quantitative near-term predictions, requests for follow-up observations, or future observing plans.
- Circulars report on high-energy, multi-messenger, and variable or transient astrophysical events.

Circulars allow the GRB community to post messages (by email, or by submitting a web form) to a public list where they are distributed rapidly to the entire GRB community and archived permanently. These prose-style messages allow the community to coordinate and make optimum use of its limited resources.
