        <Anchor>Important notes for GCN Kafka client users</Anchor>
      </CollectionHeading>
      <CollectionDescription>
        Thanks to the feedback of some of our users, we have tracked down and fixed several reliability issues related to our Kafka brokers and clients. If you are consuming GCN Notices via Kafka in Python, then please take the actions noted below.

        * **Daily Kafka outages have been resolved.** The GCN Kafka brokers had been experiencing daily outages at around 00:00 UTC and lasting from about a minute to an hour. We traced the problem to a log collection agent that was using excessive memory. We resolved the issue by disabling the agent.
        * **Python sample code has been updated.** Our [Python client sample code](/docs/client#python) was missing some necessary error handling. Some errors that may occur in the `consumer.consume()` loop are reported in the returned Kafka message. If you consume GCN Notices via Kafka in Python using the [gcn-kafka-python](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-kafka-python) client or [confluent-kafka-python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python), then please be sure to update your code as follows.

          If your client consume loop looks like this:

          ```python
          while True:
              for message in consumer.consume(timeout=1):
              value = message.value()
              # add your code to process the alert here
          ```

          then add an `if` statement to skip normal processing for errors, like this:

          ```python
          while True:
              for message in consumer.consume(timeout=1):
              if message.error():
                  print(message.error())
                  continue
              value = message.value()
              # add your code to process the alert here
          ```
        * **New version of Python client.** We have released version 0.3.3 of our [official Python client, gcn-kafka-python](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-kafka-python). This version improves the reliability of authentication for long-lived connections. Please update to the latest version. If you are not using our official client but you are using [confluent-kafka-python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) directly, then please update to the latest version of confluent-kafka-python (2.2.0 or newer).

        <Anchor>GCN Classic Outage Due to Local Network Maintenance</Anchor>
      </CollectionHeading>
      <CollectionDescription>
        Due to planned network maintenance at GSFC, the connections to GCN Classic will be offline on Saturday, May 6 from 8AM ET (12:00 UTC) and concluding no later than 3PM ET (19:00 UTC).  This affects the following GCN services:
        * GCN Classic Notices distribution via socket, VOEvent, and email
        * GCN Classic Notices web site archive
        * GCN Classic-to-Kafka connection and distribution of Notices via Kafka and email
        * Forwarding of GCN Circulars submitted to gcncirc@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov, however submission to circulars@gcn.nasa.gov and the [web form](/circulars) will be unaffected.

        <Anchor>New GCN Circulars Service Coming April 17, 2023</Anchor>
      </CollectionHeading>
      <CollectionDescription>
        We are pleased to announce that on April 17, 2023, the General Coordinates Network will launch the most significant overhaul of GCN Circulars since its inception in 1997. The modernized GCN Circulars experience will be part of the new GCN web site.
        After the transition on April 17, you will be able to:
        - Browse and search Circulars in our all-new [archive](/circulars).
        - Sign up for and manage your own email subscriptions.
        - Enroll yourself and your colleagues to submit Circulars with arXiv-style peer endorsements for new contributors.
        - Submit Circulars with our new Web form, or continue to submit by email.

        Here is what you need to know about preparing for the transition on April 17.
        - If you use Circulars now, we will transfer your settings automatically.
        - If you receive Circulars now, you will continue to receive them.
        - If you submit Circulars now, you will still be able to submit from the same email addresses.
        - Emails from Circulars will come from a new address, no-reply@gcn.nasa.gov.
        - We will encourage you to submit Circulars to the new address, circulars@gcn.nasa.gov, but we will still support the old address gcncirc@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov.
        - The [new archive](/circulars) will include all past Circulars. We will freeze the old archive,
          https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_archive.html.

        To introduce GCN users to the [new GCN Circular system](/circulars), we invite you to join one of our three public Zoom webinars:

        - April 18, 2023 12:00-13:00 UTC (best for Atlantic):
