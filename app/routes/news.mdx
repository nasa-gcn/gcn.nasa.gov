      New GCN Circulars Service Coming April 17, 2023
    </CollectionHeading>
    <CollectionDescription>
     We are pleased to announce that on April 17, 2023, the General Coordinates Network will launch the most significant overhaul of GCN Circulars since its inception in 1997. The modernized GCN Circulars experience will be part of the new GCN web site at https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars.
     After the transition on April 17, you will be able to:
      - Browse and search Circulars in our all-new archive.
      - Sign yourself up or manage your own email subscriptions.
      - Enroll yourself and your colleagues to submit Circulars with arXiv-style peer endorsements for new contributors.
      - Submit Circulars with our new Web form, or continue to submit by email.

      Here is what you need to know about preparing for the transition on April 12.
      - If you use Circulars now, we will transfer your settings automatically.
      - If you receive Circulars now, you will continue to receive them.
      - If you submit Circulars now, you will still be able to submit from the same email addresses.
      - Emails from Circulars will come from a new address, no-reply@gcn.nasa.gov.
      - We will encourage you to submit Circulars to the new address, circulars@gcn.nasa.gov, but we will still support the old address gcncirc@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov.
      - The new archive, https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars, will include all past Circulars. We will freeze the old archive,
        https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_archive.html.

      To introduce GCN users to the new GCN Circular system, we invite you to join one of our three public Zoom webinars:
