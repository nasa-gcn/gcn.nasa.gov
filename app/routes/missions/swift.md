[Swift](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov) is a MidEx class mission operated by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/fermi/) in partnership with agencies in Italy and the United Kingdom. BAT autonomously detects gamma-ray transients, and Swift autonomously begins a sequence of follow-up observations with XRT and UVOT. All three instruments provide alerts to GCN autonomously upon the detection of transients.
