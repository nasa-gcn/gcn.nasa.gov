**Launch Date:** December 9, 2020

**End of Operations:** No specific requirement

**Data Archives:** http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gecam_events.html
GECAM is a constellation of two small X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky observatories. These two microsatellites, denoted as GECAM-A and GECAM-B, are designed to operate on opposite sides of the Earth. Each GECAM satellite features a dome-shaped array of 25 Gamma-ray detectors (GRD) and 8 Charged particle detectors (CPD). Each satellite can monitor the all-sky un-occulted by the Earth, thus two satellites together could watch the entire sky. Due to unexpected anomalies in power supply system, GECAM-A has not been able to observe yet, and GECAM-B can observe about 10 hours per day since January 14, 2021, and about 21 hours per day since May 30, 2022.
