[The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
Observatory](https://hawc-observatory.org/) is a facility designed to
observe gamma rays and cosmic rays between 100 GeV and 100 TeV. It is
located at Sierra Negra, Mexico, at an altitude of 4100 m. The HAWC
observatory has an instantaneous field of view covering 15% of the
sky, and during each 24 hour period it observes two-thirds of the sky.
