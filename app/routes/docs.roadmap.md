# Road Map

The following features are coming soon to GCN.

## GRB Name Server

In partnership with the [Transient Name Server](https://www.wis-tns.org), the GCN team is building a GRB name server that will allow GRB-detecting instruments to both name GRBs and retrieve names of already discovered GRBs. These names will be automatically ingested into GCN and associated with GCN Notices and Circulars for the same event.

## Archive

Similar in functionality to the [GCN Viewer](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/wsgi-scripts/tach/gcn_v2/tach.wsgi/), but integrated into the new GCN site, the GCN team is building an archive organized by astronomical transient and tying together associated Circulars and Notices.
