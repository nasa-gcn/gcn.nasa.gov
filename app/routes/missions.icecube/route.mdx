The [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov particle detector
deployed in the Antarctic ice beneath the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. It consists of 86 strings of
photo-detectors, extending to a depth of about 2,500 meters below the glacier's surface and
instrumenting a cubic-kilometer of ice. The Digital Optical Module photo-detectors detect the light
produced by relativistic charged particles produced by neutrino interactions in or near the instrumented
volume of ice.

IceCube is sensitive to neutrinos from all directions. As neutrinos pass through the ice, their interactions can
leave track signatures (~km in length) in the IceCube detector array when they produce secondary muons or compact
signatures (cascades of ~m in extent) when they produce secondary electrons or hadrons.
Track events can be reconstructed with an uncertainty of less than 1 degree, while cascade events
have higher signal purity. IceCube triggers on signals for neutrino energies greater than ~10 GeV
(10<sup>10</sup> eV) and can identify likely astrophysical neutrino events for neutrino
energies greater than ~50 TeV (5×10<sup>13</sup> eV) and issue alerts to the community.

The IceCube realtime alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu.

## GCN Notice Types in GCN Classic and GCN Classic Over Kafka

IceCube has been sending alerts generated by realtime on astrophysical neutrino searches[^1] [^2]
over the GCN classic system through the
[Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON)](https://www.amon.psu.edu). Work is underway
to update and transition these to the new GCN Kafka system.
[Detailed Descriptions and Examples are available.](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/amon.html)

## GCN Notice Types in GCN Over Kafka

**_IceCube LVK Alert Nu Track Search_**\
**topic = gcn.notices.icecube.lvk_nu_track_search**\
IceCube performs realtime searches for coincident neutrino signals with all
[LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational-wave alerts](https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/userguide/), using
a realtime muon neutrino track event selection[^3] and the sky maps from gravitational
wave detectors. These low-latency joint searches identify neutrino signals within a ±500 second time
window surrounding the LVK alert time, and aim to identify multi-messenger transient
sources and seed electromagnetic followup up observations[^4] [^5].

These searches are performed as quickly as possible, as soon as the realtime neutrino information for the 1000 second window
are available, and are repeated for each update
to the LVK alert information. The results from each repeated search will sent as a GCN notice,
including identifying information to the corresponding LVK alert version. Results from all searches
in LVK Runs 03 and 04 are available on the [IceCube Realtime Gravitational Wave Followup page](https://roc.icecube.wisc.edu/public/LvkNuTrackSearch/)

For high-significance LVK alerts, two hypothesis tests
are conducted. The first search is a maximum likelihood analysis which searches for a
generic point-like neutrino source coincident with the given GW sky map. The
second uses a Bayesian approach[^6] to quantify the joint GW + neutrino event significance, which
assumes a binary merger scenario and accounts for known astrophysical priors, such as GW source
distance, in the significance estimate. For low-significance LVK alerts, only the Bayesian search
is performed. All searches are reported via GCN Notices over Kafka, and any coincident
observation with a observed p-value less than 1% will also
be sent as a [GCN Circular](/circulars).

The GCN Notice will highlight:

- Overall search results p-values for the generic and Bayesian searches ('pval_generic' and 'pval_bayesian')
- If the analysis p-value from either search is less than 10%, the number ('n_events_coincident') and per-event information for coincident neutrino events (for events with a per-event p-value of less than 10%) are also provided:
  - 'event_dt' - relative timing of neutrino to GW alert (sec)
  - 'ra', 'dec' - reconstructed neutrino event direction (deg., J200),
  - 'ra_uncertainty' - circular direction error (deg.) at 90\% confidence.
  - 'event_pval_generic', 'event_pval_bayesian' - per-event p-values for each search. In the case of multiple coincidences, can be used to determine relative importance of each event to search results.
- If the analysis p-value from the generic transient search is less than 10%, the most likely direction from the generic neutrino source coincidence search is also given ('most_probable_direction' - RA/DEC, deg. J2000).
- 'neutrino_flux_sensitivity_range' - Time integrated flux sensitivity range (min, max) [GeV cm<sup>-2</sup>] and energy sensitivity range (lower, upper) [GeV], assuming an E<sup>-2</sup> neutrino spectrum (E<sup>2</sup> dN/dE) found within the points in the 90% region of GW map localization

The [GCN schema](/schema/stable/gcn/notices/icecube/lvk_nu_track_search.schema.json) and
example [JSON message](/schema/stable/gcn/notices/icecube/lvk_nu_track_search.example.json) files
are available to use. See our [Schema Browser](/docs/schema/stable/gcn/notices/icecube/lvk_nu_track_search.schema.json) for more information on the properties defined in the schema.

Please note: The reported p-values here do not account for any trials correction (multiple hypotheses
testing). The false alarm rate of these coincidences can be obtained by multiplying the p-values
with their corresponding GW trigger rates. All neutrino searches performed to date for
Run O3 and O4 are cataloged on the [IceCube Realtime Gravitational Wave Followup page](https://roc.icecube.wisc.edu/public/LvkNuTrackSearch/).
Rate estimates and more information on the LVK alerts can be found in the [LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Public Alerts User Guide](https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/).
