# Consuming Notices

Notices can be received via the Kafka data streaming protocol and email.

## Kafka Streaming of Notices

Subscriptions to notices via Kafka provides pipelines and robotic telescopes a realtime stream of alerts to trigger analysis or follow-up observations.

See our [Start Streaming GCN Notices quick start guide](/quickstart) for a step-by-step walkthrough to begin streaming alerts now.

See our [Kafka client setup](/docs/client) for more details about configuring your client to receive Notices, and the lightweight wrappers in [Python](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-kafka-python), [Node.js](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-kafka-js), C, and C#.

## Receiving Notices via Email

Follow these simple steps to receive GCN Notices via email in any of the 3 legacy formats (text,
binary, VOEvent), and edit your settings at will.
