# GitHub

We maintain several repositories under the [nasa-gcn](https://github.com/nasa-gcn) GitHub organization. These include kafka wrappers for [python](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-kafka-python) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-kafka-js), the new [email distribution service](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-email), and several other projects that support the new GCN.

For all projects in the [nasa-gcn](https://github.com/nasa-gcn) GitHub organization, contributors are encouraged to follow these steps:

- [Fork a copy of our repo](#forking-a-repo)

- [Clone your repo to your machine](#cloning-a-repo)

- [Create a branch for your new changes](#branching-off-main)

- [Create a Pull Request to contribute to the original project](#pull-requests)

You will need to install git on your development machine. Check out [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for installation instructions.

## Forking a Repo

Navigate to the page repository page for whichever project you wish to contribute to, for example: [gcn.nasa.gov](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov).

## Cloning a Repo

We recommend checking out [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) on adding an SSH key to your github account.

With your new fork now created, click the Code button and copy the URL in the SSH tab.

Open a terminal window and run the following

```sh
git clone <your copied repo url>
```

## Branching off main

In a terminal, set your current working directory to the cloned directory and run the following to create and switch to a new branch for your code changes:

```sh
git checkout -b <your branch name>
```

To stage your changes:

```sh
git add .
```

Create a new local commit and add a descriptive comment:

```sh
git commit -m "Your descriptive comment"
```

Push your commits out to your remote fork:

```sh
git push
```

## Pull Requests

Once you have completed your changes on your branch, create a [pull request](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/pulls).

To create a pull request, navigate to your fork in your own github repo. Click the "branches" link in the upper left hand secondary nav menu. Once you are on the branches index, click the "New pull request" button on the right hand side of the branch you would like to use. Once you have filled in your pull request title and description, click the "Create pull request" button on the lower left hand side to create the pull request.

## Issues

We use the GitHub issues pages to track bugs and other problems. To submit a new issue, navigate to the appropriate [nasa-gcn](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/) repository and click on Issues.

Click New Issue and fill out the form. Please include a concise and descriptive title and as much relevant information in the comment as possible. This includes steps to reproduce issues, screenshots, error messages, and anything else that may be helpful for us or others to pinpoint the cause of an issue.
