- Create a branch for your new changes

- Create a Pull Request to contribute to the original project

For more information, check out our [web-dev-bootcamp](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/web-dev-bootcamp) repository. In the syllabus folder you will find some instructive lectures and examples to help understand our workflow.

## Forking a Repo

Navigate to the page repository page for whichever project you wish to contribute to, for example: [gcn.nasa.gov](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov)

Click the Fork button

Click Create Fork to create a new repo in your account

## Cloning a Repo

We recommend checking out [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) on adding an SSH key to your github account.

With your new fork now created, click the Code button and copy the URL in the SSH tab.

Open a terminal window and run the following

```sh
git clone <your copied repo url>
```

## Branching off main

Within your cloned repo on your local machine, run the following to create and switch to a new branch for your code changes:

```sh
git checkout -b <your branch name>
```

## Pull Requests

Once you have completed your changes on your branch, create a [pull request](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/pulls).

To create a pull request, navigate to your fork in your own github repo. Click the "branches" link in the upper left hand secondary nav menu. Once you are on the branches index, click the "New pull request" button on the right hand side of the branch you would like to use. Once you have filled in your pull request title and description, click the "Create pull request" button on the lower left hand side to create the pull request.

## Issues

We use the GitHub issues pages to track bugs and other problems. To submit a new issue, navigate to the appropriate [nasa-gcn](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/) and click on Issues.

Click New Issue and fill out the form. Please include a concise and descriptive title and as much relevant information in the comment as possible. This includes steps to reproduce issues, screenshots, error messages, and anything else that may be helpful for us or others to pinpoint the cause of an issue.
