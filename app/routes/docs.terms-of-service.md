# Terms of Service

GCN Notices and Circulars are rapid communications which are by definition preliminary, and submitted as best-effort for the accuracy of their content. They are citable in publications, but are not peer reviewed.

The sharing of preliminary analysis and results in an open and respectful manner enables the productive exchange of information and ideas. Notices and Circulars contain factual information on observations and analysis of astronomical transients, not opinions, speculation, or disagreements with individuals or groups. The Circulars [style guide](/circulars/styleguide) provides additional criteria and community standards for Circular content.

## Retractions

If an initial automated or manually-generated Notice or Circular is later deemed to be misclassified as an astronomical object, the generating team should promptly submit another Notice or Circular informing the community of the retracted claim.

## Errata

Upon submitter request, archived circulars can be edited to correct inaccurate information, especially when the correction is important for the follow-up community's activities. These may include author lists, subject corrections, typos, and incorrect citations. This capability may not be used to add details of new observations or analysis. Users should submit new Circulars with subjects noting that they are a "refined analysis" or "additional observations".

## Peer Endorsement System

Circulars submitting privilidges are granted for new users via the GCN [peer endorsement system](/user/endorsements). Any user found to intentionally violate these terms of service, will have their Circulars submission priviledges revoked. A violater's peer endorser's submission priviledges may be subject to review.

## Reproducing GCN Notices or Circulars in External Archives

The GCN team welcomes cross-compatibility between community astronomical resources. If GCN Notices, Circulars, or their data are used in other systems, please link back to the original source materal at https://gcn.nasa.gov or https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov.

## Enforcement

The GCN system and community aim to foster an inclusive environment for the exchange of information and ideas. Mistakes are completely understandable in these forms of rapid communication, and the GCN team is happy to work with users to correct any unintentional errors. GCN will not tolerate users who are intentionally disrespectful, misrepresent data or analysis, plagerize, or reproduce data or analysis without permission of the originator or proper citation.

Circulars and/or Notice submission priviledges may be revoked for any user in violation of these community standards.

## Acknowledgement

The GCN team requests that any presentation, publication, or document that mentions the GCN system, specific GCN Circulars or Notices, to please reference the General Coordinates Network (https://gcn.nasa.gov) and cite Circulars via [SAO/NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu).

**By clicking "Agree", all users agree to abide by these community standards, and that they are subject to the enforcement procedures described above.**
