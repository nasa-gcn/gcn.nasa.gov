# Schema Browser

Browse the schema definitions for GCN Notices as distributed by GCN Kafka. Choose an option below to navigate through the schema directory or inspect a schema for additional details.

If you are interested in adding a [new notice type to GCN](/docs/notices/producers), then you can [develop a new schema](/docs/notices/schema) for your instrument or mission using our core schema as building blocks. See our [primer on the GCN Unified Schema](/docs/notices/schema) for instructions.

We welcome your feedback on the schema! Don't hesitate to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn-schema/issues) or [contact us](/contact).
