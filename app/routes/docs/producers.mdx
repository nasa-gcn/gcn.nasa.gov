# New Notice Producers

The following steps guide new instrument, mission, or observatory producers
into setting up new notices streams that are distributed to the user community
via [Kafka](faq#what-is-kafka). This process requires interaction
with the [GCN Team](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback?selected=kafkagcn)
to enable accounts and Kafka topics creation on the GCN Kafka broker. The GCN Team is
also happy to work with the mission teams to help construct your alerts.

       Sign in / Sign up 
     </ProcessListHeading>
     Decide which of your team members will have programmatic access to produce your alerts. 
     Make sure that they have all signed in at least once to the [GCN website](https://gcn.nasa.gov/login) 
     and the [GCN test website](https://test.gcn.nasa.gov/login).

         Name Your Kafka Topics
      </ProcessListHeading>
      Names of Kafka topics follow the format <code>gcn.notices.<i>mission</i>.<i>notice_type</i></code>.
      Pick a prefix for your Kafka topic names, <code><i>mission</i>.\*</code>.

      Send the [GCN Team](/contact)
   your list of team members from Step 1 and your chosen Kafka topic prefix from Step 2.
      The GCN Team will reply after they have configured producer permissions for your team.

         Build Producer Code
      </ProcessListHeading>
      - Log out and log back in.
      - Go through the [Start Streaming GCN Notices](/quickstart) process.
      - On Step 2, choose the scope <code>gcn.nasa.gov/kafka-<i>mission</i>-producer</code>.
      - Your producer code will look very similar to the [client example code](client) and
      Step 4 of [Start Streaming GCN Notices](/quickstart). `client_id` and `client_secret`
      can be found in Step 4 client example code.
      - Start from this and adjust the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `topic` and `data` content:

      ```python
      from gcn_kafka import Producer
      # Connect as a producer.
      # Warning: don't share the client secret with others.
      producer = Producer(client_id='fill me in', client_secret='fill me in')
      # any topic starting with 'mission.'
      topic = 'gcn.notices.mission.example'
      data = b'...'  # any bytes
      producer.produce(topic, data)
      ```
