# Setting up New GCN Notice Producers

The following steps guide new instrument, mission, or observatory producers
into setting up new notices streams that are distributed to the user community
via [Kafka](faq#what-is-kafka). This process requires interaction
with the [GCN Team](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback?selected=kafkagcn)
to enable accounts and kafka topics creation on the GCN Kafka broker. The GCN Team is
also happy to work with the mission teams to help construct your alerts.

## Steps to Start Publishing Alerts

       Set Up Team Member Accounts
     </ProcessListHeading>
   - Make sure that your team member(s) who will implement GCN notices in your pipeline
   has signed in at least once to https://test.gcn.nasa.gov and https://gcn.nasa.gov.
   - Send the [GCN Team](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback?selected=kafkagcn)
   a list of email address(es) of all the team members who should have the
   producer access to the <code><i>mission_name</i>.\*</code> topics.

      Provide your instrument specific kafka topics or topics to the 
      [GCN Team](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback?selected=kafkagcn).

         Build Producer Code
      </ProcessListHeading>
      - Log out and log back in.
      - Go through the [Start Streaming GCN Notices](/quickstart) process.
      - On Step 2, choose the scope <code>gcn.nasa.gov/kafka-<i>MissionName</i>-producer</code>.
      - Your producer code will look very similar to the [client example code](docs/client) and
      Step 4 of [Start Streaming GCN Notices](/quickstart). `client_id` and `client_secret`
      can be found in Step 4 client example code.
      - Start from this and adjust the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `topic` and `data` content:

      ```python
      from gcn_kafka import Producer
      # Connect as a producer.
      # Warning: don't share the client secret with others.
      producer = Producer(client_id='fill me in', client_secret='fill me in')
      topic = 'mission_name.example'
      # any topic starting with 'mission_name'
      data = b'...'  # any bytes
      producer.produce(topic, data)
      ```

         Create or Update the Mission Page
      </ProcessListHeading>
      Create a new mission page by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/pulls)
or by emailing text to the [GCN Team](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback?selected=kafkagcn).

      The GCN Team will add your new notice type to the Kafka [Quick Start](../quickstart)
      and Email Notification configuration. Please work with the
      [GCN Team](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback?selected=kafkagcn)
      on drafting a community announcement.
