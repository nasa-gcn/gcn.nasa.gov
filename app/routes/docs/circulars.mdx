# GCN Circulars

GCN Circulars are rapid astronomical bulletins submitted by and distributed to community members worldwide.

- Circulars are **brief**, **citeable**, and **human-readable**.
- Circulars can announce observations, quantitative near-term predictions, requests for follow-up observations, or future observing plans.
- Circulars report on high-energy, multi-messenger, and variable or transient astrophysical events.

Circulars allow the GRB community to **email** messages to a central queue where they are automatically vetted and distributed to the entire GRB community. These prose-style messages allow the community to coordinate and make optimum use of its limited resources.

## Subscribe

To receive GCN Circulars, [sign up or sign in](/login), then select [Email Notifications](/user/email). You can immediately sign up to receive circulars.

If you subscribed to Circulars via the legacy GCN Classic service, your subscription was automatically transferred. To edit your profile or unsubscribe, [sign up or sign in](/login).

## Submitter Authorization

To become an authorized Circulars submitter, you need to have either been a Circulars submitter in the legacy GCN Classic service or seek a [peer endorsement](/user/endorsements) from a colleague who is already an authorized Circulars submitter.

## Submit

Once authorized, Circulars users can submit either via the web form or email. Circulars are then distributed by email to all subscribers after rapid automated vetting and formatting.

### Web Form

Once you are an authorized submitter and have [signed up or signed in](/login), you can submit Circulars via the [web form](/circulars) by clicking "New".

### Email

Circulars can be submitted by emailing circulars@gcn.nasa.gov. Emails sent to the legacy email address will be accepted and processed by the new Circulars service, but we encourage use of the new address. We will phase out user of the legacy address.

## Style Guide and Required Formatting

Please explore the detailed [style guide](/docs/styleguide). In particular, the email subject must contain at least one of the following case-sensitive strings:

<a name="subject-word-list" />
<ul className="grid-row usa-list usa-list--unstyled">
  {validSubjectKeywords.map((keyword) => (
    <li key={keyword} className="grid-col-2">
      {keyword}
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

A copy of the body of your email will be distributed along with the following header:

```text
TITLE:   GCN CIRCULAR
NUMBER:  <serial number>
SUBJECT: <exact copy of your email subject>
DATE:    <date and time>
FROM:    <the name and email you used to register>
```

## Archive

GCN Circulars are automatically [archived](/circulars). The archive contains all past Circulars in reverse chronological order. It is searchable given any enclosed string, and browseable as grouped by event.

The [GCN Viewer](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/tachgcn) provides another way to search the notices and circulars archives sorted by astronomical event.
