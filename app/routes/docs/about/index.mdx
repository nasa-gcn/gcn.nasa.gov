# About GCN

## What is GCN?

The General Coordinates Network (GCN) is a public collaboration platform run by NASA for the astronomy research community to share alerts and rapid communications about high-energy, multimessenger, and transient phenomena. GCN is the established platform for publishing discoveries and follow-up of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), gravitational-wave (GW) compact binary mergers, and high-energy neutrinos. GCN distributes alerts between space- and ground-based observatories, physics experiments, and thousands of astronomers around the world.

The General Coordinates Network is the modern evolution of the [Gamma-ray Coordinates Network](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov) (now referred to as GCN Classic, and formerly known as BACODINE/TAN), updated to use modern, open-source, reliable, and secure alert distribution technologies that have been established by the broader astronomy community.

GCN has two kinds of data products:

- [**Notices**](/notices) are automated, machine-to-machine, generally real-time, notifications of detections and localizations of astronomical transients detected by space- and ground-based observatories.
- [**Circulars**](/circulars) are human-readable, citable, rapid but generally not real-time, bulletins observations, quantitative near-term predictions, requests for follow-up observations, or future observing plans.

## Contributing

The GCN web site is an open source project built in [Remix](https://remix.run), a full stack web framework. Have an idea to make GCN better and want to contribute, or have a bug to report? Head over to our [contributing](/docs/contributing) documentation for our quick start instructions.

## Road Map

Check out our [Road Map](about/roadmap.md) for features that are under development, including the Unified Schema and the GRB Name Server.

## GCN History

GCN has enabled seminal breakthroughs in astrophysics since its inception in 1992. For more details on the history of GCN, check out our [GCN History](about/history.md).

## GCN Support

The development of the GCN is funded through the NASA ISFM program.
