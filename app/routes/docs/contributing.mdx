# Contributing to General Coordinates Network

Do you have an idea to make GCN better, or do you have a bug to report? We'd love to hear from you! GCN (this site) is an [open source project on GitHub](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov). Help us by reporting feature requests and bugs in our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/issues).

Or, if you feel like rolling your sleeves up, propose a code change by [forking the project](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/fork) and submitting a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/pulls). Don't know where to start? Look for issues in GitHub that are labelled <GitHubLabel owner="nasa-gcn" repo="gcn.nasa.gov" name="good first issue"/>.

Here are some more specific ways that _you_ can help.

- **Write documentation.**
  The best and easiest way to help is to contribute text or typographical corrections, especially in the [Documentation](/docs) section (the [app/routes/docs](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/blob/main/app/routes/docs) directory in GitHub) and [Missions](/missions) section (the [app/routes/missions](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/blob/main/app/routes/missions) directory in GitHub). Look for GitHub issues with the label <GitHubLabel owner="nasa-gcn" repo="gcn.nasa.gov" name="content"/>.

  Most of the written content on this site is formatted in Markdown, an easy to use markup language. To learn Markdown, read the [GitHub Flavored Markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

  In general, written content should follow the [American Astronomical Society style guide](https://journals.aas.org/manuscript-preparation/#style) and use SI unit abbreviations.

- **Improve design and accessibility.**
  We are constantly seeking to improve the GCN user experience. Look for issues in GitHub that are marked <GitHubLabel owner="nasa-gcn" repo="gcn.nasa.gov" name="frontend"/>.

  We use the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), an open source design language and front end framework that is common to many Federal agencies. US Web Design System components for [React](https://reactjs.org) are provided by [react-uswds](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds).

- **Add new features to the web site.**
  We have lots of ideas for new features, visualizations, and ways to interact with GCN data. We bet you have lots of ideas too! Look for issues in GitHub that are marked <GitHubLabel owner="nasa-gcn" repo="gcn.nasa.gov" name="frontend"/> or <GitHubLabel owner="nasa-gcn" repo="gcn.nasa.gov" name="backend"/>.

  GCN is built in [Remix](https://remix.run), a full stack web framework built on [React](https://reactjs.org) and written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) ([JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) with type annotations).

## Quick Start

Here are instructions for getting the GCN site set up and running on your own computer for local development.

<ProcessList>
  <ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListHeading type="h3">
      Set up Node.js on your computer
    </ProcessListHeading>

    Make sure that Node.js and NPM are installed on your computer. There are several options to install Node.js and NPM. Pick _one_ of the following:

    -   Download and run [the Node.js installer for your operating system](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
    -   Install and use the [Node Version Manager, nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
    -   Install using a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

  <ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListHeading type="h3">
      Clone and configure the project
    </ProcessListHeading>

    Clone the Git repository onto your computer, install all dependencies, and install the pre-commit hooks by running these commands:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov
    cd gcn.nasa.gov
    npm install
    ```

  </ProcessListItem>
  <ProcessListItem>
    <ProcessListHeading type="h3">
      Write configuration file
    </ProcessListHeading>

    Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the repository with the following contents to define the configuration of your local development GCN server:

    ```sh
    # (Required) Signing key for session cookies.
    # Fill in with a long, random string.
    SESSION_SECRET=fill-me-in

    # (Optional) OpenID Connect identity provider configuration for Cognito.
    # If omitted, then we will use a built-in sandbox identity provider.
    # COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=fill-me-in
    # OIDC_CLIENT_ID=fill-me-in
    # OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=fill-me-in

    # (Optional) Google ReCAPTCHA configuration.
    # For parts of the site that require authentication,
    # these lines must be uncommented and filled in.
    # RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=fill-me-in
    # RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=fill-me-in

    # (Optional) URL origin to be used for external redirects, email From
    # addresses, and so on. Leave this unset for local development so that it
    # defaults to http://localhost:3333.
    # ORIGIN=https://gcn.nasa.gov
    ```

      Start development server
    </ProcessListHeading>

    Start the local development server by running the following command:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3333 to see the local site live.
