# Contributing to General Coordinates Network

Do you have an idea to make GCN better, or do you have a bug to report? We'd love to hear from you!

GCN (this site) is an open source project on GitHub at https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn. Report feature requests and bug reports in our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn/issues). Or, if you feel like rolling your sleeves up, propose a code change by submitting a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn/pulls).

## Project Overview

- GCN is built in [Remix](https://remix.run), a full stack web framework. A Remix app combines the server side code (back end) and browser side code (front end) in a single codebase (sometimes called an [isomorphic application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript)).
- We use the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), an open source design language and front end framework that is common to many Federal agencies.
- US Web Design System components for [React](https://reactjs.org) are provided by [react-uswds](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds).

The directory structure of the project is as follows:

- [app/components](https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn/blob/main/app/components): Reusable custom React components.
- [app/lib](https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn/blob/main/app/lib): Reusable TypeScript modules that are not React components.
- [app/root.tsx](https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn/blob/main/app/root.tsx): Main route for the whole web site. Edit this file to cu stomize the page template.
- [app/routes](https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn/blob/main/app/routes): Put all Web pages in here. Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for static pages or TSX (TypeScript with interleaved HTML markup) for reactive pages.
- [app/routes/api](https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn/blob/main/app/routes/api): Put API endpoints in here.

## Quick Start

Here are instructions for getting the GCN site set up on your computer for local development.

    -   Download and run [the Node.js installer for your operating system](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
    -   Install and use the [Node Version Manager, nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
    -   Install using a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

      Clone and configure the project
    </ProcessListHeading>

    Clone the Git repository onto your computer, install all dependencies, and install the pre-commit hooks by running these commands:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tachgsfc/remix-gcn.git
    cd remix-gcn
    npm install
    npm run prepare

    <ProcessListHeading type="h3">
      Write configuration file
    </ProcessListHeading>

    Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the repository with the following contents to define the configuration of your local development GCN server:

    ```sh
    # (Required) Signing key for session cookies.
    # Fill in with a long, random string.
    SESSION_SECRET=fill-me-in

    # (Optional) OIDC provider info for Cognito.
    # For parts of the site that require authentication,
    # these lines must be uncommented and filled in.

    # OIDC_PROVIDER_URL=fill-me-in
    # OIDC_CLIENT_ID=fill-me-in
    # OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=fill-me-in

    # (Optional) Cognito user pool ID for
    # client credential vending machine.

    # COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=fill-me-in
    ```
