# Advanced Search

The advanced search feature allows for searching keywords in a specific field of the circular. The search feature uses the [Lucene query syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html) to specify the field and search term.

## Searching by Field

Searches can be performed by specifying the field and search term. The syntax for this is `field:"search term"`. For example, to search for circulars with the word 'Swift' in the subject field, the query would be `subject:"Swift"`.

The following fields are supported: `subject`, `body`, and `submitter`.

By default, a query that does not contain lucene syntax will attempt to match the query against all 3 fields. For example, the query `Swift` will match any circular that contains the word 'Swift' in the subject, body, or submitter fields, whereas the query `subject:"Swift"` will only match circulars where the subject contains the word 'Swift'.

## Compound Queries

These separate field queries can be combined using additional keywords to form compound queries. The following boolean keywords are supported:

- `AND`/`&&`: The `AND`/`&&` operator requires that both conditions are met. For example, `subject:"Swift" AND body:"GRB"` will match circulars where the subject contains 'Swift' and the body contains 'GRB'.
- `OR`/`||`: The `OR`/`||` operator requires that at least one condition is met. For example, `subject:"Swift" OR body:"GRB"` will match circulars where the subject contains 'Swift' or the body contains 'GRB'.
- `NOT`/`!`: The `NOT`/`!` operator requires that the condition is not met and is commonly used with the `AND`/`&&` operator. For example, `subject:"LIGO" AND NOT body:"GRB"` will match circulars where the subject contains 'LIGO' and the body does not contain 'GRB'.

By default, the AND operator is used if no operator is specified. For example, `subject:"Swift" body:"GRB"` is equivalent to `subject:"Swift" AND body:"GRB"`.

It is also possible to combine these operator keywords to form more complex queries. For example, `subject:"Swift" AND (body:"GRB" OR body:"Gamma-ray burst")` will match circulars where the subject contains 'Swift' and the body contains either 'GRB' or 'Gamma-ray burst'.

Using one of these operators without an additional field query will result in an error. For example, `subject:"Swift" AND` will raise an error. For queries that do not adhere to the Lucene query syntax, GCN will fall back onto a more basic search method that matches the query against all fields with a warning message.

## Wildcards

Wildcards can be used to match a patterned search term to a field, such as searching for all Circulars related to GRBs detected in a given year by using the query `subject:"GRB21*"`. The following wildcards are supported:

- `*`: Matches any number of characters.
- `?`: Matches a single character.

## Reserved Characters

there are a number of reserved characters that have special meaning in the Lucene query syntax. These characters must be escaped using a backslash (`\`) to be treated as a literal character. Including these characters in a query without escaping them will raise an error.The reserved characters are: `+`, `-`, `=`, `&&`, `||`, `>`, `<`, `!`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `"`, `~`, `*`, `?`, `:`, `/`, `\`.

## Examples

- `Swift`: Matches circulars where the subject, body, or submitter contains 'Swift'.
- `subject:"Swift"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'Swift'.
- `body:"Swift"`: Matches circulars where the body contains 'Swift'.
- `subject:"Swift" AND body:"GRB"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'Swift' and the body contains 'GRB'.
- `subject:"Swift" OR body:"GRB"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'Swift' or the body contains 'GRB'.
- `subject:"Swift" AND (body:"GRB" OR body:"Gamma-ray burst")`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'Swift' and the body contains either 'GRB' or 'Gamma-ray burst'.
- `subject:"LIGO" AND NOT body:"GRB"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'LIGO' and the body does not contain 'GRB'.
- `subject:"GRB21*"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'GRB21' followed by any number of characters.
- `subject:"GRB21?"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'GRB21' followed by a single character.
