# Advanced Search

The full-text search feature allows for searching keywords in a specific field of the circular. The search feature uses the [Lucene query syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html) to specify the field and search term.

## Searching by Field

Searches can be performed by specifying the field and search term. The syntax for this is `field:"search term"`. For example, to search for circulars with the word 'Swift' in the subject field, the query would be `subject:"Swift"`.

The following fields are supported: `subject`, `body`, and `submitter`.

By default, a query that does not contain lucene syntax will attempt to match the query against all 3 fields. For example, the query `SWIFT` will match any circular that contains the word 'SWIFT' in the subject, body, or submitter fields, whereas the query `subject:"SWIFT"` will only match circulars where the subject contains the word 'SWIFT'.

## Compound Queries

These separate field queries can be combined using additional keywords to form compound queries. The following keywords are supported:

- `AND`: The AND operator requires that both conditions are met. For example, `subject:"SWIFT" AND body:"GRB"` will match circulars where the subject contains 'SWIFT' and the body contains 'GRB'.
- `OR`: The OR operator requires that at least one condition is met. For example, `subject:"SWIFT" OR body:"GRB"` will match circulars where the subject contains 'SWIFT' or the body contains 'GRB'.

By default, the AND operator is used if no operator is specified. For example, `subject:"SWIFT" body:"GRB"` is equivalent to `subject:"SWIFT" AND body:"GRB"`.

## Wildcards

Wildcards can be used to match a patterned search term to a field, such as searching for all Circulars related to GRBs detected in a given year by using the query `subject:"GRB21*"`. The following wildcards are supported:

- `*`: Matches any number of characters.
- `?`: Matches a single character.

## Examples

- `SWIFT`: Matches circulars where the subject, body, or submitter contains 'SWIFT'.
- `subject:"SWIFT"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'SWIFT'.
- `body:"SWIFT"`: Matches circulars where the body contains 'SWIFT'.
- `subject:"SWIFT" AND body:"GRB"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'SWIFT' and the body contains 'GRB'.
- `subject:"SWIFT" OR body:"GRB"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'SWIFT' or the body contains 'GRB'.
- `subject:"GRB21*"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'GRB21' followed by any number of characters.
- `subject:"GRB21?"`: Matches circulars where the subject contains 'GRB21' followed by a single character.
