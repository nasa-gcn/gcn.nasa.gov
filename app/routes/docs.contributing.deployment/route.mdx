# Deployment

This web site is deployed **in the cloud** on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) in order resist outages due to local network conditions or disasters.

Site assets are replicated and cached through a global **[content delivery network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)** ([AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)) to provide the fastest experience possible to scientists everywhere regardless of their country and location.

The site's architecture within AWS is entirely **[serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing)**: we run on fully managed AWS computing, storage, and database services so that resource usage and cost adjust dynamically with user demand and so that we do not have to patch or maintain the operating systems on our own machine instances.

We provision all AWS resources using **[infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)** so that the configuration of cloud services is automated and under version control. We use the [Architect](https://arc.codes/) serverless framework to model, generate, and orchestrate the AWS resources.

We perform code and infrastructure changes automatically using **[continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment)** on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (see our [deployment workflow](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).

## Stages

There are three full deployments of GCN. Each **deployment stage** is in a separate AWS account and on a separate subdomain:

## To deploy

To approve and trigger a deployment to testing or production, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the [Deploy to AWS workflow](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/actions/workflows/deploy.yml).
2. Select the desired workflow run.
3. Tap the `Review deployments` button.
4. Check the stages that you want to deploy.
5. Tap the `Approve and deploy` button.

The deployment should take about 5 minutes.

<Alert type="warning" headingLevel="h4" heading="Avoid concurrent deployments">
  Be careful not to trigger multiple deployments to the same stage at the same time because [GitHub currently has no way to prevent multiple deployment jobs for the same environment from running simultaneously](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/17401).

If a deployment is already in progress and you trigger another deployment to the same stage before it finishes, then the second deployment will probably fail harmlessly because AWS CloudFormation does not permit updating a stack while an update is already in progress.

## To deploy manually

Use the continuous deployment procedure above to deploy routine code changes or
changes to [environment variables](/docs/contributiong/configuration).

On rare occasions that code changes require the creating or modifying AWS
resources other than code, static assets, and environment variables, it may be
necessary to manually deploy the web site from your development computer,
because of the limited permissions associated with the AWS IAM role used by the
continuous deployment pipeline. To manually deploy the web site from your own
computer, first [configure the AWS credentials file on your computer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).
Then, run the following commands:

```
npm run clean
npm i
npm i --os=linux --cpu=arm64
npm run build
npx arc deploy --prune --production --no-hydrate
```
