# GCN Notices

GCN Notices consist of distributing the GRB/transient locations determined by transient missions. The collection and distribtuion of these Notices is done without any humans-in-the-loop, and as such for missions with real-time downlinks, the time delays from when the GRB/transient happened to when the Notices is sent out to the customer is on the order of 2-10 secs. This combining of all the sources of GRB/transient location information into a single network means that sites need only maintain a single interface for all their GRB/transient needs.
