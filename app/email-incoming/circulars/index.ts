As of April 12, 2023, GCN Circulars are being administered through the new General Coordinates Network (GCN; ${origin}), and no longer through the GCN Classic service (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov).

The new GCN Circulars allow you to:

- Browse and search Circulars in our all-new archive.
- Sign yourself up or manage your own email subscriptions.
- Enroll yourself and your colleagues to submit Circulars with arXiv-style peer endorsements for new contributors.
- Submit Circulars with our new Web form, or continue to submit by email.

If you have not already done so, we encourage you to make an account at ${origin}. Even if you have not yet created a new account, these features provide continuity with the legacy GCN Classic service:

- Your Circulars settings have been transferred automatically.
- You are able to submit Circulars from the same email addresses registered in the legacy service.
- Emails from GCN come from a new address, no-reply@${hostname}.
- We encourage you to submit Circulars to the new address, circulars@${hostname}, but we still support the old address gcncirc@capella2.gsfc.nasa.gov.
- The new archive, ${origin}/circulars, includes all past Circulars. We have frozen the old archive, https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_archive.html.

For more information about the GCN Circulars, please see ${origin}/circulars.
