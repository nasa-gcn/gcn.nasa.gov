# General Coordinates Network Web Site

[![Node.js CI status](https://github.com/tachgsfc/gcn.nasa.gov/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tachgsfc/gcn.nasa.gov/actions)

This is the source code for the General Coordinates Network web site, https://gcn.nasa.gov. It is based upon Remix, a web framework built on React and written in TypeScript (a strongly typed superset of JavaScript). It combines the server side code (back end) and browser side code (front end) in a single codebase (sometimes called an "isomorphic application"). This project was bootstrapped using the create-remix template.
