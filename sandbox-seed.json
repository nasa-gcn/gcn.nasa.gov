Ho (Cornell), Eric Burns (LSU), Michael Coughlin (UMN) report: \n\nWe report the identification of a fast-evolving red transient by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM). AT 2023sva is located at the position (J2000) of:\n\nRA = 00:56:59.19 (14.24662 deg)\nDec = +80:08:44.12 (80.14559 deg)\n\nIt was first detected by ZTF on 2023-09-17 09:38:31 UT at r = 17.71 +/- 0.05 mag (MJD=60204.40175) and g = 18.49 +/- 0.06 mag (MJD=60204.44580) as part of the public all-sky survey. ZTF also obtained a non-detection ~2 days prior at r > 20.91 mag  (MJD=60202.24319), indicating a fast rise rate of >1.5 mag/day in r. The transient was detected in follow-up Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) observations at r = 20.22 +/- 0.08 mag (MJD=60205.48761) and g = 20.73 +/- 0.10 mag (MJD=60205.48597), implying red colors and rapid fading (~2.3 mag/day fade in r). \n\nAT2023sva was also detected by ATLAS (ATLAS23srq) at MJD 60204.43499 and saved to the TNS (Tonry et al. 2023, TNS Report No. 188327). The last ATLAS non-detection was at MJD 60202.48470. The Galactic latitude of AT 2023sva is 17.27 degrees, and the Galactic reddening toward the direction of AT 2023sva is: E(g-r) = 0.249 from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011).\n\nThe fast rise, fast decay, red color, and lack of an archival optical counterpart make AT 2023sva a strong candidate afterglow. We identify the temporally and spatially coincident Fermi-GBM trigger bn230916144 / 716527670, initially classified as a GRB with 64% probability at position (J2000) of RA, Dec = 00:26:52.8, +87:43:12. The localization error radius is 21.44 deg. The time of the GBM trigger was 2023-09-16 03:27:46 UT (MJD=60203.14428), 1.3 days prior to the first ZTF detection of AT 2023sva. If the Fermi-GBM trigger is indeed a GRB then we suggest this as the prompt counterpart to AT 2023sva. If the trigger is of another origin, then no identified prompt signal has been reported thus far.\n\nWe encourage spectroscopic follow-up observations.\n\nZTF is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. AST-2034437 and a collaboration including Caltech, IPAC, the Weizmann Institute for Science, the Oskar Klein Center at Stockholm University, the University of Maryland, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron and Humboldt University, the TANGO Consortium of Taiwan, the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, Trinity College Dublin, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and IN2P3, France.

Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:\n\nAnalysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al., 2021, JApA, 42, 73) showed the detection of GRB 230919A which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (Fermi GBM Team, GCN Circ. 34737).\n\nThe source was clearly detected in the CZT detectors in the 20-200 keV energy range. The light curve showed multiple peaks of emission with the strongest peak at 2023-09-19 16:58:23.95 UTC. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 1118 (+205, -166) counts/s above the background in the combined data of all quadrants, with a total of 921 (+115, -92) counts. The local mean background count rate was 406 (+10, -15) counts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 1.58 (+1.38, -0.23) s. We caution that there are two 0.3 s readout dead time windows in CZTI data immediately after the detection of the burst. Hence, the T90 can be as large as 2.96 s for this GRB, with a lower limit of 1.35 s as estimated above by cumulative rates.\n\nThe source was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range. The light curve peaks at 2023-09-19 16:58:23.55 UTC. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 1196 (+82, -86) counts/s above the background in the combined data of all quadrants, with a total of 1796 (+193, -200) counts. The local mean background count rate was 1280 (+6, -6) counts/s. We measure a T90 of 2.1 (+1.2, -0.5) s from the cumulative Veto light curve.

Excluding the event that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-230914A. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-230914A is 1.4e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 2e+02 GeV and 7e+04 GeV. \n\nA subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2023-09-13 05:21:03.710 UTC to 2023-09-15 05:21:03.710 UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of 1.00, consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-230914A is 1.6e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window. \n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

Angail (IAO) report on behalf of the GIT team:\n\nWe observed the field of GRB 230816A detected by SWIFT (Siegel  et al., GCN 34450) with 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). We started observations at 16:40:00 UT, i.e., 31.2 mins after the Swift/BAT trigger. We obtained 5 frames in the r' band of 300 sec each. After image subtraction, we detected a source in our stacked image at RA 21:53:46.96, Dec: +37:51:16.08 with an uncertainty of 0.67 arcsec - coincident with the reported afterglow (Jiang et al., GCN 34453), and 3.75 arsec away from center of the XRT error circle (Siegel et al., GCN 34450). \n\nWe note that there is a faint source (m_r ~ 23.0) nearly coincident with the counterpart in the Pan-STARRS1 images, which could be a host of this GRB. Our image subtraction ensures that this source flux does not affect out photometric measurements. There is no minor planet present at this position. The photometric results are as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n JD (mid) | T_mid-T0 (mins) | Exposure (sec) | Filter | Magnitude (AB) |\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 2460173.202193 | 42.35  | 5 x 300 | r' | 20.61 +/- 0.06  |\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur results are consistent with other reports (Jiang et al. GCN 34453, Moskvitin et al., GCN 34456, Pankov et al., GCN 34457, Odeh et al., GCN 34458, Klose et al., GCN 34459). We encourage photometric for further confirmation and spectroscopic follow-up for redshift measurement. The magnitudes are calibrated against PanSTARRS DR1 (Chambers et al., 2016) and are not corrected for Galactic extinction.\n\nThe GROWTH India Telescope (GIT; Kumar et al. 2022) is a 70-cm telescope with a 0.7-degree field of view, set up by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) with funding from DST-SERB and IUSSTF.

The IceCube event was detected on 2023-07-27 at 16:05:39.63 UT (T0) with J2000 position RA =  33.66 (+1.16, -0.77) deg, Decl. = 7.63 (+0.70, -0.64) deg (90% PSF containment). There are no Fermi 4FGL-DR4 cataloged  gamma-ray (>100 MeV; The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2022, ApJS, 260, 53; Ballet et al. 2023, arXiv:2307.12546) sources in the 90% IC230727A uncertainty localization region.\n\nWe searched for intermediate (days to years) timescale emission from a new gamma-ray source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the IC230727A best-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a point source at the IC230727A best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 1.2e-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~15-years (2008-08-04 to 2023-07-27 UTC), and < 4.1e-9 (< 6.0e-8) ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month (1-day) integration time before T0.\n\n\nSince Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this region will continue. For these observations the Fermi-LAT contact persons are S. Garrappa (simone.garrappa at weizmann.ac.il), C. Bartolini (chiara.bartolini at ba.infn.it), S. Buson (sara.buson at uni-wuerzburg.de) and J. Sinapius (jonas.sinapius at desy.de).\n\nThe Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.\n\n",

Perley (LJMU) report on behalf of the ZTF and GROWTH collaborations:\n\nWe observed the localization region of the LVC trigger S230917af as part of routine Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Graham et al., 2019; Bellm et al., 2019) survey operations. We obtained images in the r and g bands beginning at 2023-09-17T10:05:51 UT (8 seconds after the LVC trigger time), covering ~83% of the probability enclosed in the localization region. Our observations covered ~92% of the overlapping region between the MAXI low significance burst (GCN 34723) and the GW event. \n\nWe queried the ZTF alert stream using Kowalski (Duev et al. 2019) through Fritz (Coughlin et al. 2023), AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019), and ZTFReST (Andreoni & Coughlin et al., 2021). We required at least 2 detections separated by at least 15 minutes to select against moving objects. Furthermore, we cross-match our candidates with the Minor Planet Center to flag known asteroids, reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018), and apply machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We require that no spatially coincident ZTF alerts were issued before the detection time of the LVC trigger. We also run forced photometry on ZTF images (Masci et al. 2019) and require no detections before the LVC trigger.\n\nNo candidates passed our filtering criteria. Furthermore, we run forced photometry over two years of ZTF data at the center of the Swift sources circulated in Evans et al. (GCN 34736) with a 1 arcsec radius, and we queried ZTF alerts within their 90% error region. Three of the six Swift sources have previous detections and can be associated to ZTF objects. These sources are unlikely to be associated with the GW trigger: \n\nSwift name | ZTF name | JD discovery | magnitude at discovery\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nS230917af_X9  | ZTF18abvbsom | 2460152.82912 | g = 20.24\nS230917af_X1  | ZTF18abvucic | 2460206.80333 | g = 18.93\nS230917af_X10 | ZTF18abvzkzr | 2459817.80154 | g = 20.44\n\nNo predetections or alerts in the ZTF archive were found for the Swift sources S230917af_X3, S230917af_X4, and S230917af_X6. However, we note that (1) S230917af_X3 is 2.3 arcsec from a GALEX point-like UV source, at nuv = 20.03 mag, (2) S230917af_X4 is 2.5 arcsec from a Gaia source at g = 20.62 mag with a proper motion ~5.16 mas/year, and (3) S230917af_X6 is 9 arcsec from a WISE galaxy and its colors (W1-W2 = 0.9 mag, and W2-W3 =  2.6 mag) are indicative of a QSO/Seyfert galaxy. \n\n\nZTF and GROWTH are worldwide collaborations comprising Caltech, USA; IPAC, USA, WIS, Israel; OKC, Sweden; JSI/UMd, USA; U Washington, USA; DESY, Germany; MOST, Taiwan; UW Milwaukee, USA; LANL USA; Tokyo Tech, Japan; IITB, India; IIA, India; LJMU, UK; TTU, USA; SDSU, USA and USyd, Australia.

We obtained 4x300s + 1x60s exposures in the r’ band at a mid-epoch of 2023-08-13 20:15 UT, leading to the following preliminary photometry estimate:\n\nr’ = 20.32 +/- 0.06 mag\n\nWe finally obtained 1h of exposure (2x15min + 1x30min) in spectroscopic mode, using the blue setting of MISTRAL. We clearly detect the continuum associated with the transient emission, leading to a redshift upper limit (z<2.5) consistent with the redshift determination obtained by the GTC and the NOT (de Ugarte Postigo et al., GCN 24409, 34410). The signal to noise in the final combined spectrum is however not sufficient to securely identify any absorption line.\n\nWe acknowledge Claire Moutou as well as the excellent support from Jean Balcaen and Yoann Degot-Longhi (Observatoire de Haute Provence).",

After further study, we now believe this event to likely be due to a highly inclined muon bundle. Muon bundles are a background arising from down-going cosmic-ray air showers and are not from a neutrino of astrophysical origin.\n\nThis conclusion is driven by observations with the IceTop surface array portion of IceCube at the time of the alert. The IceTop surface array detects charged particles from cosmic ray induced extensive air showers that occur in the atmosphere above the IceCube detector. A preliminary offline cross check of IceTop data indicates a background origin for this alert.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL\n[2], and MBTA [3] analysis pipelines.\n\nS230922g is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as\nestimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-24 Hz, or about one in 1e16\nyears.

Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:\n\nWe have carried out a search for X-ray candidates in Astrosat CZTI data in a 100-sec window around the trigger time of the event S230802aq (UTC 2023-08-02 11:33:59, GraceDB event). We use the bayestar.multiorder.fits,0 map (https://gracedb.ligo.org/api/superevents/S230802aq/files/bayestar.multiorder.fits,0) for our analysis. CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has a considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the time of the merger, Astrosat's nominal pointing is RA, DEC = 17:22:28.7, -41:35:57.7 (260.6196,-41.5994), which is ~128 deg away from the maximum probability location. At the time of the merger event, the Earth-satellite-transient angle corresponding to the maximum probability location is ~53 deg and is occulted by Earth in the satellite's frame. In a time interval of 100 sec around the event, the region of the localization map not occulted by Earth in the satellite's frame has a total probability of 0.70 (70%) of containing the source.\n\nCZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from the four independent, identical quadrants for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.1s, 1s, and 10s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in background count rates were estimated by using data from 5 preceding orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in a 100-sec window is 10^-4. We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.\n\nWe use a detailed mass model of the satellite to calculate the direction-dependent instrument response for points in the visible sky. We then assume the source is modeled as a power law with photon index alpha = -1, and convert our count rate upper limits to direction-dependent flux limits. We obtain the following upper limits for source flux in the 20-200 keV band by taking a probability-weighted mean over the visible sky:\n\n0.1 s: flux limit= 1.68e-05 ergs/cm^2/s; fluence limit = 1.68e-06 ergs/cm^2\n1.0 s: flux limit= 3.31e-06 ergs/cm^2/s; fluence limit = 3.31e-06 ergs/cm^2\n10.0 s: flux limit= 3.84e-07 ergs/cm^2/s; fluence limit = 3.84e-06 ergs/cm^2\n\nCZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, URSC, IUCAA, SAC, and PRL.

The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked\nstructure with a duration of about 25 sec.  The peak count rate\nwas ~1900 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 16:10:18.4 UT, 90.2 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,\nuncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 328.44552,\n37.85549 which is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 21h 53m 46.92s\n   Dec(J2000) = +37d 51' 19.8\"\nwith an uncertainty of 1.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This\nlocation is 223 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position. This position\nmay be improved as more data are received; the latest position is\navailable at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.90 x\n10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 3.7\n(+3.48/-2.91) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 93 seconds after the BAT trigger.

The data comprise 386 s in Windowed Timing\n(WT) mode (the first 10 s were taken while Swift was slewing) with the\nremainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. \n\nThe light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays.

At T+345 s  the decay\nsteepens to an alpha of 2.5 (+0.4, -0.3) before breaking again at\nT+1364 s to a final decay with index alpha=1.26 (+0.16, -0.30).\n\nA spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed\npower-law with a photon spectral index\tof 1.02 (+/-0.04).

The time-averaged spectrum shows that it could be adequately fit by a Band function with a fluence about 2E-4 erg/cm2 in 20-1000 keV. We note that this analysis is based on realtime alert data and thus very preliminary. Refined analysis will be reported later.\n\nGravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All sky Monitor (GECAM) mission originally consists of two microsatellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) launched in Dec. 2020.

Galloway; V. Dhillon; P. O'Brien; G. Ramsay; K. Noysena; R. Kotak; R. P. Breton; L. K. Nuttall; E. Pall'e and D. Pollacco report on behalf of the GOTO collaboration:\n\nWe report on observations with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO; Steeghs et al. 2022) in response to GRB 230918B (Fermi GBM team, GCN 34734). Three targeted observations were performed by GOTO-South between 09:15:23 UT and 11:31:06 UT on 2023-09-19, corresponding to 0.39, 0.44 and 0.48 days after trigger. Each observation consisted of 4x90 s exposures in the GOTO L-band (400-700 nm).\n\nImages were processed immediately after acquisition using the GOTO pipeline. Difference imaging was performed using recent survey observations of the same pointings. Source candidates were initially filtered using a classifier (Killestein et al. 2021) and cross-matched against a variety of contextual and minor planet catalogues. Human vetting was carried out in real time on any candidates that passed the above checks.\n\nWe identify a fast-rising optical source within the GBM 90% localisation region:\n\nName | RA(J2000) | Dec(J2000)\nGOTO23aky | 20:54:37.14 | -48:40:29.33\n\nThe L-band AB magnitudes at each epoch are measured to be 20.34 +/- 0.16, 20.18 +/- 0.11, and 20.03 +/- 0.10, respectively. This corresponds to a rise of 3.3 +/- 2.0 mag/day.\n\nWe find no evidence of this source prior to the GRB trigger time in previous GOTO observations (taken ~6 days prior to the GRB) or the ATLAS forced photometry server (Shingles et al. 2021, taken ~ 1 day prior to the GRB). No underlying source is present at the position in the Legacy Server (Dey et al. 2019).\n\nMagnitudes were calibrated using ATLAS-REFCAT2 (Tonry et al. 2018) and are not corrected for Galactic extinction.\n\nGOTO (https://goto-observatory.org) is a network of telescopes that is principally funded by the STFC and operated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, Spain, and Siding Spring Observatory in NSW, Australia, on behalf of a consortium including the University of Warwick, Monash University, Armagh Observatory & Planetarium, the University of Leicester, the University of Sheffield, the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT), the University of Turku, the University of Portsmouth, the University of Manchester and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC).\n\n",

The candidate\nwas found by the GstLAL [1] analysis pipeline.\n\nS230802aq is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as\nestimated by the online analysis, is 2.2e-08 Hz, or about one in 1\nyear, 5 months. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S230802aq\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending\nprobability, is BBH (90%), NSBH (6%), Terrestrial (3%), or BNS (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability\nthat the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass\n(HasNS) is 57%. [2] Using the masses and spins inferred from the\nsignal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object\n(HasRemnant) is <1%. [2] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the\nsupport of several neutron star equations of state. The probability\nthat either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses\n(HasMassGap) is 68%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the\nGraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 26 seconds after the\ncandidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the\ncandidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,1.

The time-averaged spectrum\nfrom T0+0.002 to T0+3.264 s is best fit by\na Band function with Epeak = 235 +/- 25 keV,\nalpha = -0.6 +/- 0.1, and beta = -2.22 +/- 0.09.\n\nThe event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is\n(1.20 +/- 0.03)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured\nstarting from T0+1.1 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 27 +/- 2 ph/s/cm^2.\n\nThe spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;\nfinal results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/fermi/fermigbrst.html\n\nFor Fermi GBM data and info, please visit the official Fermi GBM Support Page:\nhttps://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/gbm/\"",

This localization was generated by crossmatching the 90% confidence region of the neutrino error circle with the updated Bilby gravitational-wave localization [3].  We obtained a series of g- and r-band images covering 47.2 square degrees of the localization at least once, beginning at 2023-09-06T09:38:48.998 (2 days after the burst trigger time), corresponding to ~94% of the probability enclosed in the combined localization region.\n\nWe queried the ZTF alert stream using Kowalski (Duev et al. 2019) through Fritz (Coughlin et al. 2023), AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019), and ZTFReST (Andreoni & Coughlin et al., 2021). We required at least 2 detections separated by at least 15 minutes to select against moving objects. Furthermore, we cross-matched our candidates with the Minor Planet Center to flag known asteroids, reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018), and applied machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We required that no spatially coincident ZTF alerts were issued before the detection time of the LVK trigger.

Observations were performed by GOTO North and South between 04:19:47 UT on 2023-09-11 and 17:08:39 UT on 2023-09-12 (1.17 to 37.98 hours after trigger). Each observation consisted of 4x90s exposures in the GOTO L-band (400-700 nm).\n\nImages were processed immediately after acquisition using the GOTO pipeline. Difference imaging was performed using recent survey observations of the same pointings. Source candidates were initially filtered using a classifier (Killestein et al. 2021) and cross-matched against a variety of contextual and minor planet catalogues. Human vetting was carried out in real time on any candidates that passed the above checks.\n\nWe identify one candidate optical counterpart consistent within the GBM 90% localisation region. We find no evidence of this source prior to the GRB trigger time in previous GOTO observations, the ZTF observations provided by the Lasair broker (Smith et al. 2019), or the ATLAS forced photometry server (Shingles et al. 2021). However, we caution that the last available observation of the field was taken by ATLAS nine days before the GRB trigger.\n\nName | RA(J2000) | Dec(J2000) | Filter | Mag(AB) | t - trig(hrs)\n\nGOTO23akf | 03:50:00.51 | -29:49:30.66 | L | 19.22 +/- 0.10 | 1.17 \n\nThis source is seen to decay as a power-law with an index of 0.61 +/- 0.07 across 7 epochs of observations.

Osborne (U. Leicester) and P.A.\nEvans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:\n\nSwift-XRT has performed follow-up observations of the\nFermi/GBM-detected burst GRB 230812B in a series of observations tiled\non the sky. The total exposure time is 8.3 ks, distributed over 27\ntiles; the maximum exposure at a single sky location was 4.6 ks. The\ndata were collected between T0+25.4 ks and T0+38.1 ks, and are entirely\nin Photon Counting (PC) mode. \n\nFour uncatalogued X-ray sources are detected, of which one (\"Source 7\")\nis above the RASS 3-sigma upper limit at this position, and is\ntherefore likely the GRB afterglow. Using 4926 s of PC mode data and 4\nUVOT images, we find an enhanced XRT position (using the XRT-UVOT\nalignment and matching UVOT field sources to the USNO-B1 catalogue):\nRA, Dec = 249.13196, +47.85892 which is equivalent to:\n\nRA (J2000): 16h 36m 31.67s\nDec(J2000): +47d 51' 32.1\"\n\nwith an uncertainty of 2.1 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence). This\nposition is 106.5 arcmin from the Fermi/GBM position, but only 6.7\narcmin from the Fermi/LAT position. \n\nThe light curve can be modelled with a power-law decay with a decay\nindex of alpha=1.8 (+/-0.4).\n\nA spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed\npower-law with a photon spectral index of 1.82 (+/-0.15). The\nbest-fitting absorption column is  9.6 (+4.3, -3.9) x 10^20 cm^-2, in\nexcess of the Galactic value of 2.0 x 10^20 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.\n2013).

Swift slewed immediately to the burst. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 226.782, -41.334 which is \n   RA(J2000) = 15h 07m 08s\n   Dec(J2000) = -41d 20' 01\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex\nstructure with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate\nwas ~700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~3 sec after the trigger. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 08:49:24.4 UT, 119.0 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued\nX-ray source located at RA, Dec 226.79804, -41.32973 which is\nequivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 15h 07m 11.53s\n   Dec(J2000) = -41d 19' 47.0\"\nwith an uncertainty of 4.2 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This\nlocation is 46 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT\nerror circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;\nthe latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We\ncannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (9.36 x\n10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 4\n(+3.90/-3.22) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). \n\nProcessed UVOT data were not available at low latency, with the images\naffected by the attitude issues reported in GCN Circ. 34633. \n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is E. Sonbas (edasonbas AT yahoo.com). \nPlease contact the BA by email if you require additional information\nregarding Swift followup of this burst.

These are 4FGL J1051.6+3253 associated with the starburst galaxy NGC 3424 and 4FGL J1102.9+3014 associated with the FSRQ B2 1100+30B, at a distance of from the best-fit neutrino localization of 1.3 deg and 2.3 deg, respectively. Based on a preliminary analysis of the LAT data over a month and day timescale prior T0, these objects are not significantly detected at gamma rays.\n\nWe searched for intermediate (days to years) timescale emission from a new gamma-ray source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the IC230914A best-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a point source at the IC230914A best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 3.9e-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~15-years (2008-08-04 to 2023-09-14 UTC), and < 3.6e-9 (< 4.2e-8) ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month (1-day) integration time before T0.\n\n\nSince Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this region will continue. For these observations the Fermi-LAT contact persons are S. Garrappa (simone.garrappa at weizmann.ac.il), C. Bartolini (chiara.bartolini at ba.infn.it), S. Buson (sara.buson at uni-wuerzburg.de) and J. Sinapius (jonas.sinapius at desy.de).\n\nThe Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

The light curve comprises two broad peaks each of about 50s duration, with the peak flux observed roughly at the center of the first pulse.\n\nUsing a standard power-law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff [3] to model the emission over this duration results in a photon index dN/dE~E^x of x=-0.5 and a cutoff energy (\"Epeak\") of 371 keV.  The modeled 10-10000 keV fluence is 2.9e-05 erg/cm^2.\n\nThe analysis results presented here are preliminary and use a response function that lacks a detailed characterization of the surrounding passive structure of the ISS.\n\nGlowbug is a NASA-funded technology demonstrator for sensitive, low-cost gamma-ray transient telescopes developed, built, and operated by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with support from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, USRA, and NASA MSFC.  It was launched on 2023 March 15 aboard the Department of Defense Space Test Program’s STP-H9 to the ISS.  The detector comprises 12 large-area (15 cm x 15 cm) CsI:Tl panels covering the surface of a half cube, and two hexagonal (5-cm diameter, 10-cm length) CLLB scintillators, giving it a large field of view (instantaneous FoV ~2/3 sky) over a wide energy band of 50 keV to >2 MeV.\n\n[1] Grove, J.E. et al. 2020, Proc.

The UVB shows several broad undulations, not seen in GRB afterglow spectra; in the VIS and NIR arms, the continuum is smoother.\n\nThe source shows narrow absorption from Ca H and K a z = 0, as well as broad features in correspondence of the Balmer lines, at least H-beta to H-eta, all at z = 0. No features are identified at z > 0. Comparison with template spectra (e.g. Morales-Rueda & Marsh, 2002, MNRAS, 332, 814) allows us to classify AT 2023tbf as a dwarf nova.

Observations in the HAWK-I Ks band consisted in 30 minute exposure with a mean time of 6.84 days after the GRB. Observations in the FORS2 R band consisted in 40 minute exposure with a mean time of 6.76 days after the GRB. Sky conditions were modest, with a delivered seeing of ~2\" in the R band.\n\nConsistent with the position of the X-ray afterglow discovered by Chandra (O’Connor et al., GCN 34672), we detect a weak source in the stacked R-band image, at J2000 coordinates (~0.5\" error):\n\nRA = 05:19:01.57\nDec = -47:53:32.3\n\nWe measure for this source an AB magnitude R = 25.44 ± 0.25, calibrated against nearby SkyMapper stars. In the Ks band, we can only set an upper limit with AB magnitude > 23.3. As noted by O’Connor et al. (GCN 34672), there is no detected host galaxy in the Legacy Survey, which has however a depth shallower than our measurement.\n\nWhile the spatial association with the X-ray counterpart suggests a physical connection with the GRB, it is unclear whether the source is dominated by transient light or is a faint host galaxy. We note that the R-K color is not as red as was AT 2017gfo at a comparable epoch after explosion (e.g. Villar et al. 2017, ApJ, 851, L21).\n\nWe acknowledge the support of the observing staff at Paranal, in particular Ana Escorza, Linda Schmidtobreick, and Fuyan Bian.\n",

The observation started on 2023-08-25 at 00:25:40 UT and ended at 00:49:53 UT, with a total exposure of 1,055 s. \n\nThe observation began during orbit-day, which, due to the high count rate and a recent light “leak” in NICER’s X-ray Timing Instrument, led to telemetry saturation that created fragmented good-time intervals (GTIs). This is a known issue that leads to a 55 Hz “signal” (and potentially other significant features) in a power-spectral analysis. We caution future observers against astrophysical interpretations of this signal. To minimize calibration complications due to visible-light loading, we restricted our spectral analysis to only the nighttime data, with an exposure of 198 s.\n\nThroughout the observation, the source is prominently detected with a count rate varying between ~5,000 and 20,000 cts/s. Rapid (timescales less than one second) variability is observed, similar to the black-hole system V404 Cyg (ATel #16205, ATel #16206) and/or the neutron-star binary Swift J1858.6–0814 (ATel #12158). In the orbit-night-only data, the 55 Hz signal is no longer visible in power spectra, which lack narrow features (no obvious QPO or sharply periodic signal) but are dominated by a strong red-noise component. \n\nWe modeled the time-averaged spectrum (0.5-10 keV) with an absorbed power-law model plus a blackbody. We derive a photon index of 1.47+/-0.01, blackbody temperature of kT = 0.269+/-0.006 keV, and hydrogen column density of N_H = (2.26+/-0.05)e21 cm^-2. The PL+BB model fits the data well with a chi-squared of 87 for 155 degrees of freedom. We identify a hint of an iron line at around 6.4 keV. The absorption-corrected X-ray flux in the 0.5-10 keV energy band is (5.34+/-0.02)e-8 erg/cm^2/s. Assuming a distance of 3 - 6 kpc this corresponds to an X-ray luminosity of ~5e37 to 2e38 erg/s, which suggests that this is a newly discovered X-ray binary in outburst (ATel #16205, GCN #34540).\n\nFurther analysis is ongoing and additional NICER observations are planned. \n\nNICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station.

Jaodand (Caltech) report on behalf of the NuSTAR Search for INteresting Gamma-ray Signals (SINGS) working group:\n\nThe NuSTAR SINGS working group reports the detection of prompt emission from the Long GRB 230911D in both the NuSTAR CsI anti-coincidence shields and in the CdZnTe hard X-ray imagers. This GRB was identified through a blind search using the CsI shield rates. Details of the search algorithm will be described in a future paper.\n\nThe NuSTAR GRB search algorithm triggered at 2023-09-11T07:53:11, which is roughly 1.25-s after the Fermi detection (Hamburg et al., GCN Circ. 34656). When we consider the 1-s resolution of the shield data combined with the smoothing of the search algorithm, we consider the NuSTAR GRB time to be consistent with the time reported by Fermi.\n\nUsing the GRB localization (Greiner, et al., GCN Circ. 34657) and the NuSTAR trigger time, we estimate that the GRB was above the Earth's horizon as seen by NuSTAR and roughly 83-degrees off-axis from the NuSTAR boresight at the time of the GRB (e.g., through the side of the instrument).\n\nThe CsI data are recorded at 1 Hz and show a broad burst with multiple peaks. 1-sec count rates peaked at ~4,000 counts per second in both the FPMA and FPMB shield units. Typical background rates are ~1,000 counts per second.\n\nThe burst was also coincidentally detected in both CdZnTe detectors, with peak count rates of ~30 counts above 100 keV in 5-s time bins.\n\nFlux calibration from the CdZnTe detectors for far off-axis is currently not possible since the X-rays observed by the CdZnTe detectors this far off-axis likely have multiple scatters in the instrument before being recorded by the X-ray detectors. Work on understanding the response and converting measured rates to incident fluxes is on-going.\n\nThe automated light curve report for this GRB can be found here:\n\nhttps://nustarsoc.caltech.edu/NuSTAR_Public/grbs/reports/2023/230911D/\n\nInformation on NuSTAR SINGS can be found here: \n\nhttps://nustarsoc.caltech.edu/NuSTAR_Public/grbs/\n\nNuSTAR is a NASA Small Explorer mission led by Caltech and managed by JPL for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:\n\nWe have carried out a search for X-ray candidates in Astrosat CZTI data in a 100-sec window around the trigger time of the event S230731an (UTC 2023-07-31 21:53:07, GraceDB event). We use the Bilby.multiorder.fits,0 map (https://gracedb.ligo.org/api/superevents/S230731an/files/Bilby.multiorder.fits,0) for our analysis. CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has a considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky but is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the time of the merger, Astrosat's nominal pointing is RA, DEC = 00:47:41.1, 85:07:31.0 (11.9212,85.1253), which is ~60 deg away from the maximum probability location. At the time of the merger event, the Earth-satellite-transient angle corresponding to the maximum probability location is ~87 deg and hence is not occulted by Earth in the satellite's frame. In a time interval of 100 sec around the event, the region of the localization map which is not occulted by Earth in the satellite's frame has a total probability of 0.93 (93%) of containing the source.\n\nCZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We then searched data from the four independent, identical quadrants to look for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning the data in 0.1s, 1s, and 10s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in background count rates were estimated by using data from 5 preceding orbits. We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in a 100-sec window is 10^-4. We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.\n\nWe use a detailed mass model of the satellite to calculate the direction-dependent instrument response for points in the visible sky. We then assume the source is modeled as a power law with photon index alpha = -1, and convert our count rate upper limits to direction-dependent flux limits. We obtain the following upper limits for source flux in the 20-200 keV band by taking a probability-weighted mean over the visible sky:\n\n0.1 s: flux limit= 1.18e-05 ergs/cm^2/s; fluence limit = 1.18e-06 ergs/cm^2\n1.0 s: flux limit= 2.30e-06 ergs/cm^2/s; fluence limit = 2.30e-06 ergs/cm^2\n10.0 s: flux limit= 2.74e-07 ergs/cm^2/s; fluence limit = 2.74e-06 ergs/cm^2\n\nCZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, URSC, IUCAA, SAC, and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and facilitated the project.\n\nCZTI GRB detections are reported regularly on the payload site at:\nhttp://astrosat.iucaa.in/czti/?q=emgw\n"

The candidate\nwas found by the GstLAL [1] analysis pipeline.\n\nS230911ae is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as\nestimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-12 Hz, or about one in 1e4\nyears. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S230911ae\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending\nprobability, is BBH (>99%), Terrestrial (<1%), NSBH (<1%), or BNS\n(<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability\nthat the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass\n(HasNS) is <1%. [2] Using the masses and spins inferred from the\nsignal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object\n(HasRemnant) is <1%. [2] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the\nsupport of several neutron star equations of state. The probability\nthat either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses\n(HasMassgap) is <1%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the\nGraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 23 seconds after the\ncandidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [3], distributed via GCN notice about 4 minutes after the\ncandidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2. For\nthe bayestar.multiorder.fits,2 sky map, the 90% credible region is\n24221 deg2.

The light curve comprises a single peak.\n\nUsing a standard power-law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff [3] to model the emission over this duration results in a poorly constrained power-law index and a cutoff energy (\"Epeak\") of 138 keV. The modeled 10-10000 keV fluence is 1.5e-06 erg/cm^2.\n\nThe analysis results presented here are preliminary and use a response function that lacks a detailed characterization of the surrounding passive structure of the ISS.\n\nGlowbug is a NASA-funded technology demonstrator for sensitive, low-cost gamma-ray transient telescopes developed, built, and operated by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with support from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, USRA, and NASA MSFC.

The detector comprises 12 large-area (15 cm x 15 cm) CsI:Tl panels covering the surface of a half cube, and two hexagonal (5-cm diameter, 10-cm length) CLLB scintillators, giving it a large field of view (instantaneous FoV ~2/3 sky) over a wide energy band of 50 keV to >2 MeV.\n\n[1] Grove, J.E. et al. 2020, Proc.

This\nrepresents an overall pre-trial p-value of 0.0049 for the Bayesian search.\n\nThe reported p-value here does not account for any trials correction (multiple hypotheses testing). The false alarm rate of these coincidences can be obtained by multiplying the p-values with their corresponding GW trigger rates.

The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL\n[2], MBTA [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.\n\nS230831e is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as\nestimated by the online analysis, is 2e-08 Hz, or about one in 1 year,\n7 months. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S230831e\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending\nprobability, is BBH (98%), Terrestrial (2%), NSBH (<1%), or BNS (<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability\nthat the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass\n(HasNS) is <1%. [6] Using the masses and spins inferred from the\nsignal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object\n(HasRemnant) is <1%. [6] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the\nsupport of several neutron star equations of state. The probability\nthat either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses\n(HasMassGap) is <1%.\n\nThree sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from\nthe GraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 23 seconds after the\ncandidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 36 seconds after the\ncandidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the\ncandidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2. For\nthe bayestar.multiorder.fits,2 sky map, the 90% credible region is\n3326 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori\nluminosity distance estimate is 6672 +/- 2201 Mpc (a posteriori mean\n+/- standard deviation).\n\nFor further information about analysis methodology and the contents of\nthis alert, refer to the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Public Alerts User Guide\nhttps://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/userguide/.\n\n [1] Klimenko et al.

As is common for image triggers, the BAT \nlight curve does not show significant structure.  The duration \nappears to be about 20 sec.  The peak count rate was ~1400 \ncounts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~6 sec after the trigger. \n\nDue to a Moon observing constraint, Swift cannot slew to the BAT\nposition until 09:35 UT on 2023 August 27. There will thus be no XRT or\nUVOT data for this trigger before this time. \n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is K. L.

We believe this behavior has at times resulted in degraded attitude control for the spacecraft, affecting the image quality of some UVOT data (because of their coarser angular resolution, XRT and BAT data appear largely unaffected). We encourage all users to closely investigate UVOT data taken over this period (starting ~ August 7).\n\nWe are actively investigating potential mitigations to improve spacecraft attitude control, and will provide updates to the community as available.\n\nIf you have further questions, please feel free to reach out to the Swift PI, Brad Cenko, at brad.cenko@nasa.gov"

An automated, blind search for short gamma-ray bursts below the onboard triggering threshold in Fermi-GBM also identified no counterpart candidates. The GBM targeted search, the most sensitive, coherent search for GRB-like signals, was run from +/-30 s around merger time, and also identified no counterpart candidates.\n\nPart of the LVK localization region is behind the Earth for Fermi, located at an RA=335.9, Dec=25.3 with a radius of 67.6 degrees. We therefore set upper limits on impulsive gamma-ray emission for the GW localization region visible to Fermi at merger time. Using the representative soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates described in arXiv:1612.02395, we set the following 3 sigma flux upper limits over 10-1000 keV, weighted by GW localization probability (in units of 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2):\n\nTimescale  Soft   Normal   Hard \n------------------------------------\n0.128 s:     1.2       2.1       4.6\n1.024 s:     0.3       0.6       1.3\n8.192 s:     0.1       0.1       0.2\n\nAssuming the a posteriori mean luminosity distance of 444 Mpc from the GW detection, we estimate the following intrinsic luminosity upper limits over the 1 keV-10 MeV energy range (in units of 10^48 erg/s):\n\nTimescale  Soft    Normal   Hard \n------------------------------------\n0.128s:       4.3       7.0       25.\n1.024s:       1.0       2.1       7.1\n8.192s:       0.3       0.4       1.3"

      "body": "IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:\n\nSearches for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube consistent with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate S230904n in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2023-09-04 05:01:53.000 UTC to 2023-09-04 05:18:33.000 UTC) have been performed [1,2]. During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data. Two hypothesis tests were conducted. The first search is a maximum likelihood analysis which searches for a generic point-like neutrino source coincident with the given GW skymap.  The second uses a Bayesian approach to quantify the joint GW + neutrino event significance, which assumes a binary merger scenario and accounts for known astrophysical priors, such as GW source distance, in the significance estimate [3].\n\nOne track-like event is found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the gravitational-wave candidate S230904n calculated from the map circulated in the 3-Initial notice. This represents an overall p-value of 12% from the generic transient search and an overall p-value of 0.4% for the Bayesian search.  These p-values measure the consistency of the observed track-like events with the known atmospheric backgrounds for this single map (not trials corrected for multiple GW events). The most probable multi-messenger source direction based on the neutrinos and GW skymap is RA 348.40, Dec 37.26 degrees.\n\nThe reported p-values can differ due to the estimated distance of the GW candidate. The distance is used as a prior in the Bayesian binary merger search, while it is not taken into account in the generic transient point-like source search. The false alarm rate of these coincidences can be obtained by multiplying the p-values with their corresponding GW trigger rates. Further details are available at https://gcn.nasa.gov/missions/icecube.\n\nProperties of the coincident events are shown below.\n\ndt(s) \tRA(deg) \tDec(deg) \tAngular uncertainty(deg) \tp-value (generic transient) \tp-value (Bayesian)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n263 \t348.89 \t \t36.55 \t \t3.16  \t \t \t \t \t \t0.1625 \t \t \t \t \t \t \t0.0037\n\nwhere:\ndt = Time of track event minus time of GW trigger (sec)\nAngular uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a circle representing 90% CL containment by area.\np-value = the p-value for this specific track event from each search.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

Angail (IAO) report on behalf of the GIT team:\n\nWe continued observation of the field of the GRB230812B (Fermi GBM Team, GCN 34386) with 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). Starting at 15:26:30 UT on 2023-08-19, we took 18 exposures of 300 sec each in r' band and detected the optical source in our stacked images. We also observed the target with HCT (2x 25 min, PI: R Teja), and detect the source as well. The details of the photometry are given in the below table:\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nJD (mid) | T-T0 (days)| Filter | Exposure (s) | Magnitude (AB) | Telescope\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n2460176.199743 | 6.90 | r' | 18 x 300 | 22.06 +/- 0.10 | GIT\n\n2460176.196935 | 6.91 | r' | 2 x 1500 | 22.04 +/- 0.18 | HCT\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur photometry shows a significant deviation from the earlier estimated power-law decay (alpha = 1.23 +/- 0.04) and shows a rise by ~0.9 mag as compared to afterglow-only emission, suggesting the presence of a supernova component. Our results are consistent with A. S. Moskvitin et al., GCN 33475. Based on our SN + PL fits predict that the emission should rise slightly over next 15 days and will start decaying again once the SN peaks around T-T0 ~ 22 days.\n\nWe encourage the spectroscopic observation to confirm the presence of SN fully.\n\nAlso see: Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 34395, Lipunov et al., GCN 34396, Salgundi et al., GCN 34397, Ackley et al., GCN 34398, Kuin et al.

Swift slewed immediately to the burst. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 207.747, +31.185 which is \n   RA(J2000) = 13h 50m 59s\n   Dec(J2000) = +31d 11' 05\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex\nstructure with a duration of about 60 sec.  The peak count rate\nwas ~1300 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~5 sec after the trigger. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 11:27:03.3 UT, 192.3 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a fading,\nuncatalogued X-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 207.74281,\n31.19102 which is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 13h 50m 58.28s\n   Dec(J2000) = +31d 11' 27.7\"\nwith an uncertainty of 1.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This\nlocation is 25 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT\nerror circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;\nthe latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (1.41 x\n10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 3.6\n(+2.86/-2.45) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 858 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of\nthe XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. \nThe 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the\nXRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No\ncorrection has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of\n0.014. \n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is S. B. Cenko (brad.cenko AT nasa.gov). \nPlease contact the BA by email if you require additional information\nregarding Swift followup of this burst.

The GRB is not detected in the uGMRT band 5 with a 3-sigma upper limit of ~40 uJy, consistent with the results of Mohnani et al., (GCN Circ. 34727).

The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL\n[2], MBTA [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.\n\nS230807f is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as\nestimated by the online analysis, is 7.1e-08 Hz, or about one in 5\nmonths. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S230807f\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending\nprobability, is BBH (86%), Terrestrial (14%), NSBH (<1%), or BNS\n(<1%). \n\nThere was a high rate of noise transients (glitches) in both the LIGO \nLivingston and Hanford detectors which may affect the parameters or the significance \nof the candidate.\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability\nthat the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass\n(HasNS) is <1%. [6] Using the masses and spins inferred from the\nsignal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object\n(HasRemnant) is <1%. [6] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the\nsupport of several neutron star equations of state. The probability\nthat either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses\n(HasMassgap) is 4%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the\nGraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 35 seconds after the\ncandidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the\ncandidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2.

Cleveland (USRA) report on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team: \n\n\"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for GRB 230812B has a period of bad time intervals, affecting all data types and all detectors. At particularly high rates, the Time-Tagged Event (TTE) data has data-loss due to the bandwidth limit between the instrument and the spacecraft. CTIME and CSPEC data do not experience data-loss due to the electronics bandwidth, but do experience deadtime effects. Additionally, at particularly high rates both CTIME and CSPEC are affected by pulse pile-up, which will distort the spectra (see, S. Lesage et al., 2023, ApJL, 952, L42). \n\nDue to the orientation of the burst, we recommend only using BGO detector: B0, and the NaI detectors: N0, N3, N6, N7 for any analysis of this burst, as all other detectors either have an unfavorable detector-source angle (>60 degrees), or are blocked by different parts of the spacecraft.\n\nFor CTIME and CSPEC data of these detectors, pulse pile-up occurs during the time intervals of T0+0.61 to T0+1.12 seconds for the BGO detector, B0. We find pulse pile-up occurs from T0+0.54 to T0+1.70 seconds for the NaI detectors N0, N3, N6, N7. T0 is the GBM trigger time.\n\nIn the TTE data, data losses due to the bandwidth limit being exceeded occurs between roughly T0+0.5 to T0+1.4 seconds. This region includes the artificially created pulse centered at roughly T0+1.233 seconds (width of approximately 0.098 seconds), that is due to TTE drop out. We are currently reprocessing the TTE files and will alert the community when these files become available in a forthcoming circular. \n\nWe recommend the exclusion of these time intervals for GBM analysis of this burst, as well as caution using bins adjacent to these selections.\"\n",

(GCN 33302) and Urata et al. (GCN 33307) in deep Subaru archival imaging.\n\nThe optical spectra of the two candidate host galaxies were obtained with the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) instrument mounted on the 2x8.4-m LBT telescope (Mt. Graham, AZ, USA) on 2023-03-04, 27 days after the burst trigger. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3200-10000 AA, with a total of exposure time of 1.5 hours.\n\nWe detect a faint and red continuum with few emission lines for the brightest galaxy that we tentatively identify as H-alpha, and H-beta at a common redshift of z=0.429 (consistent with the photometric redshift of z = 0.484 ± 0.090 provided by SDSS, see Tomasella et al., GCN 33302). The spectral trace of the fainter galaxy is too weak to allow a reliable identification of any emission line, thus not permitting its redshift estimate.\n\nMultiband photometry was also collected between June and July (4-5 months after the GRB trigger) in the r, z and H bands, with both galaxies detected in all filters. These images also show an additional fainter host galaxy candidate at coordinates 13:28:16.56 +46:43:34.7, underlining the complexity of the field.\n\nWe acknowledge the excellent support from the LBTO and LBT-INAF staff, particularly D.

The Fermi GBM Final Real-time Localization was reported at GCN 34369.\n\nThe angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 36 degrees.\n\nThe GBM light curve consists of a multiple-emission episode with a duration (T90) of about 62 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0-4.6 to T0+69.1 s is best fit by a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff. The power law index is -1.07 +/- 0.06 and the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 430 +/- 60 keV.\n\nThe event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (1.31 +/- 0.06)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+18 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 6.4 +/- 0.3 ph/s/cm^2.\n\nThe spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary; final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/fermi/fermigbrst.html\n\nFor Fermi GBM data and info, please visit the official Fermi GBM Support Page: https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/gbm/\"",

GCN 34400) with OSIRIS+ mounted on the 10.4m GTC telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma (Spain). The observation consisted of spectroscopy with an exposure time of 3x900s and grism R1000B, with a wavelength coverage between 3600 and 7800 AA. The first spectrum started at 21:37 UT, 1.110 days after the burst.\n\nIn a preliminary reduction using old calibrations, the spectrum shows a strong trace with both emission and absorption lines which we identify as MgII, MgI, CaII, CaI in absorption, and [OII] and [OIII] in emission, at a common redshift of 0.360, which we interpret as the redshift of the GRB.\n\nAt this redshift, and assuming a fluence of 3.27e-4 erg/cm^2 as reported by Fermi/GBM (Roberts et al. GCN34391), the burst would have an Eiso = 8.3e52 erg. Together with a Ep = 273 keV (Roberts et al. GCN34391), GRB 230812B is consistent with the Amati relation for long GRBs.\n\nWe acknowledge excellent support from the GTC staff.",

Parsotan (GSFC/UMBC/CRESSTII) report on behalf of the Neil\nGehrels Swift Observatory Team:\n\nAt 10:49:55 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and\nlocated GRB 230815A (trigger=1185505).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 184.772, -58.065 which is \n   RA(J2000) = 12h 19m 05s\n   Dec(J2000) = -58d 03' 53\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked\nstructure with a duration of about 2 sec.  The peak count rate\nwas ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 10:52:04.0 UT, 128.1 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,\nuncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 184.72347, -58.05386 which\nis equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 12h 18m 53.63s\n   Dec(J2000) = -58d 03' 13.9\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This\nposition may be improved as more data are received; the latest position\nis available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (4.94 x\n10^21 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 7.8\n(+3.75/-3.24) x 10^21 cm^-2 (90% confidence). \n\nThe initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 2.07e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10\nkeV). \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 155 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of\nthe XRT error circle. Because of the density of catalogued stars, further\nanalysis is required to report an upper limit for any afterglow in the\nsub-image. Data from the list of sources generated on-board are not available\nat this time. No correction has been made for the large, but uncertain,\nextinction expected. \n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is N. J. Klingler (noelklin AT umbc.edu). \nPlease contact the BA by email if you require additional information\nregarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after\ntrying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see\nSwift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)\n\n",

      "body": "O.J. Roberts (USRA/NASA-MSFC), S. Bala (USRA), C. Meegan (UAH)\nreport on behalf of the Fermi GBM Team:\n\n\"At 03:27:45.98 UT on 16 September 2023, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)\ntriggered on trigger 716527670/230916144 as a GRB with 64% confidence). This trigger \nwas later followed up by GOTO (Vail et al., GCN 34730), identifying a candidate afterglow \n(AT 2023sva) and suggested it was the counterpart.\n\nCareful inspection of the GBM trigger by the Fermi-GBM Team identified a weak \nC1-class solar flare occurring contemporaneously at the trigger time, which dominates \nthe spectrum below 50 keV. There is approximately several hundred counts in the \n50-300 keV band over 12s, which the Team was able to localize. The on-ground calculated \nlocation using the Fermi GBM trigger data over this energy range is \nRA = 143.0, Dec = 70.5 (J2000 degrees, equivalent to J2000 9h 32m, +/- 70d 30'), with a \nstatistical uncertainty of 8.0 degrees (radius, 1-sigma containment, statistical only; there \nis additionally a systematic error which we have characterized as a core-plus-tail model, \nwith 90% of GRBs having a 3.7 deg error and a small tail suffering a larger than 10 deg \nsystematic error. [Connaughton et al. 2015, ApJS, 216, 32] ). \n\nWe note that this localization is 71 degrees from the Sun, and is quite far from the \nRA and Dec of the afterglow candidate reported by Vail et al. in GCN 34730. We therefore \nbelieve these two events to be unrelated and suggest that AT2023sva is an orphan afterglow. \nWe also note that this weak burst is contaminated by the solar flare and that any meaningful \ndata regarding the nature of this transient is likely unrecoverable.\n\nThe skymap can be found here:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2023/bn230916144/quicklook/glg_skymap_all_bn230916144.png\n\nThe HEALPix FITS file, including the estimated localization systematic, can be found here:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2023/bn230916144/quicklook/glg_healpix_all_bn230916144.fit\n\nThe GBM light curve can be found here:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/gbm/triggers/2023/bn230916144/quicklook/glg_lc_medres34_bn230916144.gif\""

This was about 55 days (27 days rest frame) after the likely explosion epoch of the event (Gompertz et al., GCN 34023). Observations were obtained with the NIRSpec clear prism in the 0.5-5.3 micron wavelength range.\n\nAssuming a redshift of z=1.027 (Perley et al.

Based on the observed spectral properties, we identify the supernova associated to ZTF23aaoohpy/AT2023lcr as a broad-lined type Ic SN similar to other SNe accompanying GRBs. To date, this is the furthest GRB-SN association with robust spectroscopic confirmation.\n\nFurther analysis and observations are ongoing.\n\nWe thank the staff of STScI for their work to get these observations rapidly scheduled, in particular Alison Vick, Tony Keyes, Mario Gennaro and Armin Rest.",

The T90 duration measured by GRBAlpha is 73 s and the overall significance during T90 reaches 30 sigma.\n\nThe light curve obtained by GRBAlpha is available here: \nhttps://grbalpha.konkoly.hu/static/share/GRB230827A_GCN.pdf\n\nAll GRBAlpha detections are listed at: https://monoceros.physics.muni.cz/hea/GRBAlpha/ \nGRBAlpha, launched on 2021 March 22, is a demonstration mission for a future CubeSat constellation (Werner et al. Proc. SPIE 2018). The detector of GRBAlpha consists of a 75 x 75 x 5 mm3 CsI scintillator read out by a SiPM array, covering the energy range from ~50 keV to ~1000 keV. To increase the duty cycle and the downlink rate, the upgrade of the on-board data acquisition software stack is in progress. The ground segment is also supported by the radio amateur community and it takes advantage of the SatNOGS network for increased data downlink volume. \n",

The observation started on the 19th September 2023 at 03:56 UT (3.020 days after the Fermi-GBM trigger) consisted of a 30 s r-band acquisition followed by 3x900 s spectra with grism R1000B, covering the wavelength range between 3700 and 7800 angstroms.\n\nThe spectrum displays a clear continuum across the entire spectral range, with two absorption systems. This is consistent with the object being a GRB afterglow. The first system, at a redshift of 1.307, shows clear absorption from Fe II and Mg II. A higher redshift system is revealed by a trough consistent with Lyman-alpha at a redshift of 2.281. At the same redshift, we identify weak tentative absorptions of O I, Si II, C IV and Fe II, although several other typically strong lines are missing. We propose z = 2.281 as the redshift of the GRB afterglow.\n\n\n"

The BAT light curve showed a wide pulse\nstructure with a duration of about 60 sec.  The peak count rate\nwas ~3000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 06:51:30.3 UT, 64.1 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find a bright,\nfading, uncatalogued X-ray source located at RA, Dec 76.23952, 19.56147\nwhich is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 05h 04m 57.48s\n   Dec(J2000) = +19d 33' 41.3\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment).

The T90 duration measured by GRBAlpha is 18 s and the overall significance during T90 reaches 8.3 sigma.\n\nThe light curve obtained by GRBAlpha is available here: https://grbalpha.konkoly.hu/static/share/GRB230826A_GCN.pdf\n\nAll GRBAlpha detections are listed at: https://monoceros.physics.muni.cz/hea/GRBAlpha/ \nGRBAlpha, launched on 2021 March 22, is a demonstration mission for a future CubeSat constellation (Werner et al. Proc. SPIE 2018). The detector of GRBAlpha consists of a 75 x 75 x 5 mm3 CsI scintillator read out by a SiPM array, covering the energy range from ~50 keV to ~1000 keV. To increase the duty cycle and the downlink rate, the upgrade of the on-board data acquisition software stack is in progress. The ground segment is also supported by the radio amateur community and it takes advantage of the SatNOGS network for increased data downlink volume. \n",

Grefenstette reports on behalf of the NuSTAR Search for INteresting Gamma-ray Signals (SINGS) working group:\n\nThe NuSTAR SINGS working group reports the discovery of prompt emission from a potential GRB 230916A in the NuSTAR CsI anti-coincidence shields. This GRB was identified through a blind search using the CsI shield rates. Details of the search algorithm will be described in a future paper. \n\nThe CsI data are recorded at 1 Hz and show a broad burst with a single peak. 1-sec count rates peaked at >10,000 counts per second in both the FPMA and FPMB shield units. Typical background rates are ~1,000 counts per second. The peak of the burst is unresolved (e.g., shorter than the 1-s bins) with a decay back to quiescence of ~5-s. Offline analysis shows that the peak time was 2023-09-16T13:28:47.5. As no other instrument has yet reported this burst we cannot rule out a non-astrophysical origin. However, the fact that both CsI shields show the peak and show similar decay rates are suggestive of an astrophysical origin.\n\nThe burst was not detected in either of the CdZnTe detectors.\n\nThe NuSTAR data alone are insufficient to provide any localization information for this burst.\n\nThe automated light curve report for this GRB, discovery report, and off-line analysis of the shield rates to determine the peak time can be found here.\n\nhttps://nustarsoc.caltech.edu/NuSTAR_Public/grbs/reports/2023/230916A/\n\nInformation on NuSTAR SINGS can be found here: \n\nhttps://nustarsoc.caltech.edu/NuSTAR_Public/grbs/\n\nNuSTAR is a NASA Small Explorer mission led by Caltech and managed by JPL for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \n",

Perley (LJMU) report on behalf of the ZTF and GROWTH collaborations:\n\nWe observed the localization region of the GRB 230812B (trigger 713559497, GCN 34386) detected by the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the Fermi satellite with the 47 square-degree Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera (Graham et al., 2019; Bellm et al., 2019). We obtained images in the g-, and r- covering 420 square degrees beginning at 2023-08-13 03:34:57 (~8.5 hours after the burst trigger time). This corresponds to ~78% of the probability enclosed in the Earth-occultation corrected GRB localization map. Each exposure was 300 seconds with median depths of 21.9 mag in both g-band and r-band. The images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC (Masci et al. 2019).\n\nWe queried the ZTF alert stream using Kowalski (Duev et al. 2019) through Fritz (Coughlin et al. 2023). We required at least 2 detections separated by at least 15 minutes to select against moving objects. Furthermore, we cross-match our candidates with the Minor Planet Center to flag known asteroids, reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018), and apply machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019). We require that no spatially coincident ZTF alerts were issued before the detection time of the GBM trigger. Close to 40 sources were time and spatially coincident with the burst, most of them showing g-r ~ 0 mag and a slow evolution. \n\n\nWe recover the candidate afterglow reported in Zheng et al. (GCN 34395) and Lipunov et al. (GCN 34396), and we highlight its rapid evolution: r-band decay rate ~2 mag/day. We note that this source is ~6\" from the source circulated in Page et al. (GCN 34394) detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.\n\nWe additionally crossmatched the optical candidates to the Swift sources circulated and in Evans et al (GCN 34388, http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00115) and we find no other coincidences.\n\nThe details of the afterglow candidate in the table below: \n\nZTF name , AT name , UT first alert , t-t0 (days) , filter , mag (AB) , mag error (AB)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nZTF23aaxeacr , AT 2023pel , 2023-08-13 03:34:56 , 0.35 , r , 18.85 , 0.04\nZTF23aaxeacr , AT 2023pel , 2023-08-13 04:24:05 , 0.39 , g , 19.19 , 0.02 \n\n\nWe encourage further follow-up.\n\n\nZTF and GROWTH are worldwide collaborations comprising Caltech, USA; IPAC, USA, WIS, Israel; OKC, Sweden; JSI/UMd, USA; U Washington, USA; DESY,\nGermany; MOST, Taiwan; UW Milwaukee, USA; LANL USA; Tokyo Tech, Japan; IITB, India; IIA, India; LJMU, UK; TTU, USA; SDSU, USA and USyd, Australia.\nZTF acknowledges the generous support of the NSF under AST MSIP Grant No 1440341.\nGROWTH acknowledges generous support of the NSF under PIRE Grant No 1545949.\nAlert distribution service provided by DIRAC@UW (Patterson et al. 2019).\nAlert database searches are done by AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019) and Kowalski (Duev et al. 2019).

The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.04 (+0.19, -0.18)\nand a best-fitting absorption column of 7.0 (+1.5, -1.3) x 10^21 cm^-2.\nThe counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor\ndeduced from this spectrum  is 4.3 x 10^-11 (7.6 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2\ncount^-1. \n\nA summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:\nTotal column:\t     7.0 (+1.5, -1.3) x 10^21 cm^-2\nGalactic foreground: 6.3 x 10^20 cm^-2\nExcess significance: 8.1 sigma\nPhoton index:\t     2.04 (+0.19, -0.18)\n\nIf the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of\n1.19, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 6.2 x 10^-3 count s^-1,\ncorresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.6 x\n10^-13 (4.7 x 10^-13) erg cm^-2 s^-1.\n\nThe results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at\nhttp://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/01181187.\n\nThis circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.\n",

The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL\n[2], MBTA [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.\n\nS230920al is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as\nestimated by the online analysis, is 3.2e-10 Hz, or about one in 1e2\nyears. The event's properties can be found at this URL:\n\nhttps://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S230920al\n\nThe classification of the GW signal, in order of descending\nprobability, is BBH (>99%), Terrestrial (<1%), BNS (<1%), or NSBH\n(<1%).\n\nAssuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability\nthat the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass\n(HasNS) is <1%. [6] Using the masses and spins inferred from the\nsignal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object\n(HasRemnant) is <1%. [6] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the\nsupport of several neutron star equations of state. The probability\nthat either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses\n(HasMassgap) is <1%.\n\nTwo sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the\nGraceDB event page:\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 29 seconds after the\ncandidate event time.\n * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by\nBAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the\ncandidate event time.\n\nThe preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,1.

The peak of the event localization probability was at an angle of 75 deg with respect to the spacecraft pointing axis. This orientation implies strongly suppressed (21% of optimal) response of ISGRI, somewhat suppressed (44% of optimal) response of IBIS/Veto, and near-optimal (89% of optimal) response of SPI-ACS. \nWe note that due to large localization uncertainty, sensitivity is strongly dependent on the actual source location within the uncertainty.\n \nThe background within +/-300 seconds around the event was rather stable (excess variance 1.2).\n \nWe have performed a search for any impulsive events in INTEGRAL SPI-ACS (as described in [2]) data.\n \nWe do not detect any significant counterparts and estimate a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 1.8e-07 erg/cm^2 (within the 50% probability containment region of the source localization) for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut off power law with alpha=-0.5 and Ep=600 keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s around T0. For a typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the derived peak flux upper limit is ~1.5e-07 (4.2e-08) erg/cm^2/s at 1 s (8 s) time scale in 75-2000 keV energy range.\n\nWe report for completeness and in order of FAP, all excesses identified in the search region.

The Fermi GBM\nFinal Real-time Localization reported in GCN 34652 is\nconsistent with the Swift-XRT and GOTO localizations.\n\nThe angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 54 degrees.\n\nThe GBM light curve consists of a single peak with a\nduration (T90) of about 36 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged\nspectrum from T0-4 to T0+30 s is best fit by a Band function\nwith Epeak= 98 +/- 21 keV, alpha = -1.1 +/- 0.1 and\nbeta = -2.0 +/- 0.1.\n\nThe event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is\n(6.2 +/- 0.3)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured\nstarting from T0+2.0 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 3.7 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.\n\nThe spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;\nfinal results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/fermi/fermigbrst.html\n\nFor Fermi GBM data and info, please visit the official Fermi GBM Support Page:\nhttps://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/gbm/\"",
