The Fermi GBM\nFinal Real-time Localization was reported in GCN 33104, and it is\nconsistent with the IPN triangulation (Kozyrev et al., GCN 33123)\n\nThe GBM light curve consists of two emission episodes with a duration\n(T90) of about 129 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from\nT0-3 s to T0+129 s is best fit by a power law function with an\nexponential high-energy cutoff.  The power law index is -1.18 +/- 0.03\nand the cutoff energy, parameterized as Epeak, is 340 +/- 32 keV.\n\nThe event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (2.98 +/-\n0.10)E-5 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from\nT0+4.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 20.7 +/- 0.4 ph/s/cm^2.\n\nA Band function fits the spectrum equally well with Epeak= 229 +/- 35\nkeV, alpha = -1.10 +/- 0.05 and beta = -1.90 +/- 0.08.\n\n\nThe spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;\nfinal results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:\nhttps://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/fermi/fermigbrst.html\n\nFor Fermi GBM data and info, please visit the official Fermi GBM Support Page:\nhttps://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/gbm/\"",

No cataloged gamma-ray sources \n(>100 MeV; The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2022, ApJS, 260, 53) are located \nwithin the 90% IC221229A localization region.\n\nWe searched for intermediate (days to years) timescale emission from a \nnew gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no \nsignificant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the IC221229A \nbest-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 \nfixed) for a point source at the IC221229A best-fit position, the >100 \nMeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 1.3e-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for \n~14-years (2008-08-04 to 2022-12-29 UTC), and < 1.2e-8 (<8.8e-8) ph \ncm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month (1-day) integration time before T0.\n\nSince Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular \nmonitoring of this region will continue.

We started observations in the g- and r-band beginning at 2022-12-24 02:35 UTC, approximately 18.9 hours after event time. We covered 76.2% (1.0 sq deg) of the reported localization region. This estimate accounts for chip gaps. First exposures were 300s with a typical depth of 21.0 mag.\n\nThe images were processed in real-time through the ZTF reduction and image subtraction pipelines at IPAC to search for potential counterparts (Masci et al. 2019). AMPEL (Nordin et al. 2019, Stein et al. 2021) was used to search the alerts database for candidates. We reject stellar sources (Tachibana and Miller 2018) and moving objects, and apply machine learning algorithms (Mahabal et al. 2019).

Excluding the event that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-Cascade 230109A.The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-Cascade 230109A ranges from 1.5e-01 to 1.6e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 2e+02 GeV and 6e+04 GeV.\n\nA subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2023-01-08 11:12:11.290 UTC to 2023-01-10 11:12:11.290 UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of 1.00, consistent with no significant excess of track events.

      "body": "The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:\n\n\nIceCube has performed a search [1] for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of IceCube-230112A (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33161.gcn3) in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2023-01-12 06:36:30.600 UTC to 2023-01-12 06:53:10.600 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding the event that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-230112A. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-230112A ranges from 1.4e-01 to 1.5e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 3e+02 GeV and 2e+05 GeV.\n\n\nA subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2023-01-11 06:44:50.600 UTC to 2023-01-13 06:44:50.600 UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of 0.06, consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-230112A is 1.6e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window.\n\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

Lien (U Tampa), K. L. Page (U Leicester), D. M. Palmer (LANL),\nT. Sakamoto (AGU) and M. A. Williams (PSU) report on behalf of the\nNeil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:\n\nAt 21:04:43 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and\nlocated GRB 230116D (trigger=1149293).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 98.594, 49.840d which is \n   RA(J2000) = 06h 34m 23s\n   Dec(J2000) =  +49d 50' 24\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  Due to a communications gap the BAT\nlightcurve before T+8 s is not immediately available, but\nthe later lightcurve indicates activity out to at least T+30 s. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 21:06:54.1 UT, 130.9 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued\nX-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 98.61709, 49.87257\nwhich is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 06h 34m 28.10s\n   Dec(J2000) = +49d 52' 21.3\"\nwith an uncertainty of 1.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This\nlocation is 128 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the\nBAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are\nreceived; the latest position is available at\nhttps://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 1.65\nx 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 133 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of\nthe XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated\non-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically\ncomplete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected\nextinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.112. \n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is E. Sonbas (edasonbas AT yahoo.com). \nPlease contact the BA by email if you require additional information\nregarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after\ntrying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see\nSwift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)",

Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB), A. D'Ai\n(INAF-IASFPA) and E. Sonbas report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:\n\nWe have analysed 6.7 ks of XRT data for GRB 230116D (Sonbas et al. GCN\nCirc. 33176), from 113 s to 40.1 ks after the  BAT trigger. The data\ncomprise 47 s in Windowed Timing (WT) mode (the first 10 s were taken\nwhile Swift was slewing) with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC)\nmode. The enhanced XRT position for this burst was given by Osborne et\nal. (GCN Circ. 33180).\n\nThe light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The\ninitial decay index is alpha=1.87 (+0.28, -0.19). At T+559 s  the decay\nflattens to an alpha of 0.72 (+0.10, -0.28) before breaking again at\nT+11.3 ks to a final decay with index alpha=2.4 (+2.5, -0.8).\n\nA spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed\npower-law with a photon spectral index of 1.75 (+0.20, -0.09). The\nbest-fitting absorption column is  consistent with the Galactic value\nof 1.6 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). The counts to observed\n(unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor deduced from this\nspectrum  is 3.9 x 10^-11 (4.8 x 10^-11) erg cm^-2 count^-1. \n\nA summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:\nTotal column:\t     1.6 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2\nGalactic foreground: 1.6 x 10^21 cm^-2\nExcess significance: <1.6 sigma\nPhoton index:\t     1.75 (+0.20, -0.09)\n\nIf the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of\n2.4, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 5.1 x 10^-4 count s^-1,\ncorresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.0 x\n10^-14 (2.4 x 10^-14) erg cm^-2 s^-1.\n\nThe results of the XRT-team automatic analysis are available at\nhttp://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/01149293.\n\nThis circular is an official product of the Swift-XRT team.",

Swift slewed immediately to the burst. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 40.937, -65.676 which is \n   RA(J2000) = 02h 43m 45s\n   Dec(J2000) = -65d 40' 33\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty). The BAT light curve showed a single-peaked\nstructure with a duration of about 10 sec.  The peak count rate \nwas ~800 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~1 sec after the trigger. \nThe immediately available BAT light curve does not include data \nfrom ~T+8 s to ~T+100 s. There might be additional burst emission \nin that time interval. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 10:21:13.6 UT, 88.8 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued\nX-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 40.85977, -65.68672\nwhich is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 02h 43m 26.34s\n   Dec(J2000) = -65d 41' 12.2\"\nwith an uncertainty of 1.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment).

This position may be improved as more data are\nreceived; the latest position is available at\nhttps://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source\nis fading at the present time. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.95 x\n10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 1.3\n(+1.44/-1.26) x 10^22 cm^-2 (90% confidence). \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 92 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 12% of\nthe XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. \nThe 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the\nXRT error circle.

The IceCube event was detected on 2023-01-22 at 03:50:02.00 \nUT (T0) with J2000 position RA = 16.79 (+3.17, -2.56) deg, Decl. = +7.78 \n(+3.44, -3.26) deg (90% PSF containment). Five cataloged gamma-ray (>100 \nMeV; The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2022, ApJS, 260, 53) sources are \nlocated within the 90% IC230122A localization region. Based on a \npreliminary analysis of the LAT data over the timescales of 1-month \nprior to T0, one of these objects,�� the source 4FGL J0100.3+0745 \nassociated to the BL Lac object GB6 J0100+0745 (at 1.68 deg offset from \nthe best-fit neutrino localisation), is detected at ~4 sigma level. The \nflux measured for the source, is however consistent with the average \nvalue measured in the 4FGL.\n\nWe searched for intermediate (days to years) timescale emission from a \nnew gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no \nsignificant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the IC230122A \nbest-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 \nfixed) for a point source at the IC230122A best-fit position, the >100 \nMeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 2.9e-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for \n~14-years (2008-08-04 to 2023-01-22 UTC), and < 6.5e-9 (<1.4e-7) ph \ncm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month (1-day) integration time before T0.\n\nSince Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular \nmonitoring of this region will continue. For these observations the \nFermi-LAT contact persons are S. Garrappa (simone.garrappa at \nruhr-uni-bochum.de), J. Sinapius (jonas.sinapius at desy.de) and S. \nBuson (sara.buson at uni-wuerzburg.de).\n\nThe Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the \nenergy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

Three cataloged gamma-ray (>100 MeV; The\nFermi-LAT collaboration 2022, ApJS, 260, 53) sources are located within the\n90% IC230201A  localization region. Based on a preliminary analysis of the\nLAT data over the timescales of 1-day and 1-month prior to T0, these\nobjects are not significantly detected (> 5 sigma).\n\nWe searched for intermediate (days to years) timescale emission from a new\ngamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant\n(> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the IC230201A best-fit\nposition. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a\npoint source at the IC230201A best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper\nlimit (95% confidence) is < 2.8e-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~14-years (2008-08-04\nto 2023-02-01 UTC), and < 3.6e-9 (<2.4e-7) ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month\n(1-day) integration time before T0.\n\nSince Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular\nmonitoring of this region will continue. For these observations the\nFermi-LAT contact persons are S. Garrappa (simone.garrappa at\nruhr-uni-bochum.de), J. Sinapius (jonas.sinapius at desy.de) and S. Buson\n(sara.buson at uni-wuerzburg.de).\n\nThe Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy\nband from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

Perley (LJMU) reports on behalf of a larger collaboration:\n\nWe observed the location of the fast optical transient ZTF23aabmzlp/AT2023azs (Andreoni et al., GCN 33229) using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) on 2023 January 31 between 04:49 and 05:23 (UT).  Observations were carried out using the X-band receivers at a mean frequency of 10 GHz.\n\nWe detect a source at a location of RA = 11:30:16.468, Dec=+65:51:10.007 (J2000; RMS statistical accuracy +/- 0.02\"), consistent with the optical position.  The flux density is 136 (+/- 6) microJy at 9 GHz and 76 (+/- 7) microJy at 11 GHz.  The mean observation time is approximately 59975.22, 2.96 days after the first reported optical detection.\n\nThe detection of radio emission supports the conclusion that the source is the afterglow of a relativistic explosion at cosmological distance.  The unusual spectral index is likely due to interstellar scintillation.\n\nWe thank the VLA staff for rapidly scheduling and executing these observations.\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimerNone",

The BAT ground-calculated position is\nRA, Dec = 326.023, -34.394 deg which is\n   RA(J2000)  =  21h 44m 05.6s\n   Dec(J2000) = -34d 23' 37.4\"\nwith an uncertainty of 1.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).\nThe partial coding was 100%.\n\nThe mask-weighted light curve shows two broad peaks, one centered around T+0,\nand the other at T+165 seconds.  There is a third, more narrow and weaker peak\nat T+50 seconds and some possible subsidiary peaks.  Note that not all of the event\ndata is available, so it is possible that the burst extended before or after this period.\nT90 (15-350 keV) is 174.48 +- 5.26 sec (estimated error including systematics).\n\nThe time-averaged spectrum from -9.68 to T+175.22 sec is best fit by a power law\nwith an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.02 +- 0.36,\nand Epeak of 91.0 +- 44.0 keV (chi squared 37.14 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this\nmodel the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 4.6 +- 0.3 x 10^-6 erg/cm2\nand the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+0.23 sec in the 15-150 keV band is\n1.8 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.

The images were combined from 3 frames with 300 sec exposure time for g and r bands, and 2 frames with 300 sec exposure time for i band, taken under poor seeing conditions (4\".0 average) and at a median airmass of 1.5. The second epoch was performed at 20:38 UT on 29 of January 2023 (MJD = 59973.860). The images were combined from 2 frames with 300 sec exposure time for each band, taken under variable seeing conditions (1\".8 average) and at a median airmass of 1.5.\n\nWe used PSF photometry to measure the transient brightness with template subtraction using the SDSS images, and derived the following preliminary magnitudes and 3-sigma limits (all in the AB system):\n\n2023-01-28:\ng > 20.18 mag,\nr > 19.21 mag, and\ni > 19.13 mag.\n\n2023-01-29:\ng > 21.82 mag,\nr = 21.78 +/- 0.15 mag, and\ni = 21.34 +/- 0.13 mag.\n\nGiven magnitudes are calibrated against SDSS field stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.01 mag in the direction of the counterpart (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).\n\nOur measurements of the photometric evolution of ZTF23aabmzlp/AT2023azs are consistent with previous optical observations reported from Kumar et al., GCN 33230; Gupta et al., GCN 33237; Pankov et al., GCN 33239; Strausbaugh et al., GCN 33241.",

Excluding the event that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-230201A. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-230201A is 1.3e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 2e+02 GeV and 1e+05 GeV.\n\nA subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2023-01-31 06:20:54.421 UTC to 2023-02-02 06:20:54.421 UTC).

Sbarufatti (INAF-OAB),\nM. H. Siegel (PSU), A. Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) and M. A. Williams (PSU)\nreport on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Team:\n\nAt 02:56:57 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and\nlocated GRB 230204A (trigger=1152509).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 238.164d, -50.858d which is \n   RA(J2000) = 15h 52m 39s\n   Dec(J2000) = -50d 51' 27\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  Due to a telemetry gap, the BAT lightcurve\nbefore T+8s is not immediately available, and no obvious variation is\nvisible in the remainder of the lightcurve, as is typical for an\nimage trigger. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 02:59:24.1 UT, 146.8 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. XRT found a bright, uncatalogued X-ray source located\nat RA, Dec 238.1950, -50.9167 which is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 15h 52m 46.80s\n   Dec(J2000) = -50d 55' 00.1\"\nwith an uncertainty of 5.0 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). \n\nThe initial flux in the 2.5 s image was 2.77e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.2-10\nkeV). \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 156 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of\nthe XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated\non-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically\ncomplete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the large, but\nuncertain, extinction expected. \n\nWe note that this source is near the Galactic plane (lat=2.38 deg)\nand was detected as a 64 s image trigger, which raises the possibility\nthat this is a Galactic transient.  We would name this source\nSwift J1552.8-5055 if it is not a GRB. \n\nFurther analysis of the nature of this source will require the\nfull downlinked dataset. \n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is A. D'Ai (antonino.dai AT inaf.it). \nPlease contact the BA by email if you require additional information\nregarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after\ntrying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see\nSwift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)",

Siegel (PSU) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels Swift\nObservatory Team:\n\nAt 10:29:51 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and\nlocated GRB 230205A (trigger=1152764).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 202.072d, +46.684d which is \n   RA(J2000) = 13h 28m 17s\n   Dec(J2000) = +46d 41' 01\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  Due to a telemetry gap, the BAT light curve\nbefore T+8s is not immediately available, and after that time shows \nno obvious variability.  The BAT rate trigger was on a 3 s timescale,\nconsistent with the lack of variation at later times. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 10:31:40.0 UT, 108.8 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued\nX-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 202.07147, 46.72613\nwhich is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 13h 28m 17.15s\n   Dec(J2000) = +46d 43' 34.1\"\nwith an uncertainty of 1.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This\nlocation is 151 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the\nBAT error circle. This position may be improved as more data are\nreceived; the latest position is available at\nhttps://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We cannot determine whether the source\nis fading at the present time. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density in excess of the Galactic value (2.09 x\n10^20 cm^-2, Willingale et al. 2013), with an excess column of 1.2\n(+0.71/-0.56) x 10^22 cm^-2 (90% confidence). \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 100 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers none of\nthe XRT error circle. The 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated\non-board covers 100% of the XRT error circle. The list of sources is typically\ncomplete to about 18 mag. No correction has been made for the expected\nextinction corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.036. \n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is E. Ambrosi (elena.ambrosi AT inaf.it). \nPlease contact the BA by email if you require additional information\nregarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after\ntrying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see\nSwift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)",

The BAT ground-calculated position is\nRA, Dec = 202.057, 46.686 deg which is\n   RA(J2000)  =  13h 28m 13.7s\n   Dec(J2000) = +46d 41' 08.1\"\nwith an uncertainty of 2.3 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).\nThe partial coding was 100%.\n\nThe mask-weighted light curve shows a short pulse that starts at ~T0,\npeaks at ~T+2 s, and ends at ~T+3 s. In addition, there may be some\nhint of extended emission that lasts till ~T+80 s. T90 (15-350 keV)\nis 2.30 +- 0.36 sec (estimated error including systematics).\n\nThe time-averaged spectrum from T+0.32 to T+2.87 sec is best fit by a simple\npower-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is\n1.44 +- 0.29.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.6 +- 0.3 x 10^-7\nerg/cm2.\nThe 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+1.74 sec in the 15-150 keV band\nis 0.9 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence\nlevel.\n\nThe results of the batgrbproduct analysis are available at\nhttp://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/1152764/BA/",

Our spectra cover the wavelength range \n3000-25000 AA, and consist of 4 exposures by 600 s each. The observation \nmid time was 2023 Feb 6.22 UT (31.4 hr after the GRB).\n\nIn a 30 s image taken with the acquisition camera on Feb 6.19 UT, we \ndetect the optical afterglow, for which we measure a magnitude r = 21.55 \n+- 0.18 AB (calibrated against a single nearby star from the Pan-STARRS \ncatalog).\n\nA faint continuum is the detected in the visible and near-infrared arms. \nSeveral, weak absorption features can be identified, which we interpret \nas due to Mg II, Mg I and Fe II at a common redshift of z = 2.142. While \nindividual lines have low S/N, the combined detection of multiple \nfeatures provides a convincing measurement of the redshift of this \nabsorption system.\n\nThe association with the PGC1 0045721 galaxy group is thus a chance \nsuperposition, as already suggested by Smartt et al. (GCN 33278).\n\nWe acknowledge excellent support from the ESO observing staff in \nParanal, in particular Claudia Paladini and Heidi Korhonen.",

Tohuvavohu (U Toronto) report on behalf of the Neil Gehrels\nSwift Observatory Team:\n\nAt 05:52:15 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and\nlocated an image peak (trigger=1153670).  Swift slewed immediately\nto the location. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 50.745, +7.153 which is \n   RA(J2000) = 03h 22m 59s\n   Dec(J2000) = +07d 09' 11\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve shows strong variation\nwith the 207s period of the known source LSV +44 17, which is currently\nin strong outburst with an intensity of about 2 Crab and which was\nin the BAT Field Of View at the time. One of the peaks corresponds\nwith the time of the trigger and has an amplitude of ~200 counts/sec\n(15-350 keV), consistent with the previous peak of the source. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 05:54:19.7 UT, 124.4 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. No source was detected in 1.4 ks of promptly downlinked\ndata. We are waiting for the full dataset to detect and localise the\nXRT counterpart. \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 126 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 25% of\nthe BAT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. \nThe 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the\nBAT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No\ncorrection has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of\n0.298. \n\nDue to the BAT rate trigger being due to the known source  LSV +44 17,\nthe marginal significance of the image peak (7.17 in onboard imaging,\nrefined to 6.2 sigma in further ground processing), and the lack\nof an XRT afterglow detection, we believe that this trigger is\nnot due to an astrophysical GRB. \n\nFurther analysis to conclusively determine the origin of this\ntrigger will be performed on the ground-downlinked data. \n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is N. J. Klingler (noelklin AT umbc.edu). \nPlease contact the BA by email if you require additional information\nregarding Swift followup of this burst. In extremely urgent cases, after\ntrying the Burst Advocate, you can contact the Swift PI by phone (see\nSwift TOO web site for information: http://www.swift.psu.edu/)",

Swift slewed immediately to the burst. \nThe BAT on-board calculated location is \nRA, Dec 113.966, -8.015 which is \n   RA(J2000) = 07h 35m 52s\n   Dec(J2000) = -08d 00' 53\"\nwith an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including \nsystematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a complex\nstructure with a duration of about 20 sec.  The peak count rate\nwas ~700 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. \n\nThe XRT began observing the field at 14:50:15.1 UT, 100.3 seconds after\nthe BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued\nX-ray source with an enhanced position: RA, Dec 113.95924, -8.01160\nwhich is equivalent to:\n   RA(J2000)  = 07h 35m 50.22s\n   Dec(J2000) = -08d 00' 41.8\"\nwith an uncertainty of 1.9 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This\nlocation is 27 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT\nerror circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;\nthe latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper.  We\ncannot determine whether the source is fading at the present time. \n\nA power-law fit to a spectrum formed from promptly downlinked event\ndata gives a column density consistent with the Galactic value of 3.17\nx 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al. 2013). \n\nUVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White filter\nstarting 105 seconds after the BAT trigger. No credible afterglow candidate has\nbeen found in the initial data products. The 2.7'x2.7' sub-image covers 100% of\nthe XRT error circle. The typical 3-sigma upper limit has been about 19.6 mag. \nThe 8'x8' region for the list of sources generated on-board covers 100% of the\nXRT error circle. The list of sources is typically complete to about 18 mag. No\ncorrection has been made for the expected extinction corresponding to E(B-V) of\n0.197. \n\nThe XRT position is 3.8\" from the galaxy WISEA J073550.15-080045.2\n\nBurst Advocate for this burst is N.

GCN Circ. 33328) on\n14:50:01 UT, Feb. 16th, 2023, about  87 seconds after the Swift trigger\nwith C-GFT (Chinese Ground Follow-up Telescope in SVOM mission) in System\nTest Mode (STM). C-GFT is located at Jilin (long.=126.33 deg, lat.=\n43.8243778 deg), Changchun Observatory, National Astronomical\nObservatories, CAS. It has FOV of 1.5 deg X 1.5 deg with a 4k*4k CMOS\ndetector mounted on the primary focus of  1.2-meter-aperure telescope.\n\nA series of g and r band images were obtained. The exposure time was 10-30\nseconds for each frame.\n\nThe bright star USNO-B1 0819-0175793 is located within the XRT enhanced\nerror box (Osborne et al., GCN 33331) which has been reported (Gendre et\nal.,GCN 33329;  Mohammad Odeh GCN 33330). No optical afterglow was detected\nwith an image subtraction by the first r band image with an image obtained\n43 minutes after.  A limit magnitude of 18.5 mag is derived for r-band\nsingle frame (in STM) after calibration with nearby UCAC 4 catalogs.\n\nMore detailed analysis is continuing.\n\nWe thank the observation assistant Bowen Li at Jilin observatory for their\nexcellent support.\n\nThis message may be cited.",

The IceCube event was detected on 2023-02-17 at 20:49:43.4 UT (T0) with J2000 position RA = 124.54 (+1.67, -3.27) deg, Decl. = +20.74 (+2.14, -2.46) deg (90% PSF containment). Three cataloged gamma-ray (>100 MeV; The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2022, ApJS, 260, 53) sources are located within the 90% IC230217A localization region. These are the BL Lac object 4FGL J0816.9+2050 (a.k.a. 3FHL J0816.9+2050, 5BZB J0816+205), the blazar 4FGL J0817.1+1955 (a.k.a. CRATES J081705+1958) and the BL Lac object 4FGL J0823.3+2224 (a.k.a. OJ 233). Based on a preliminary analysis of the LAT data, these objects are not significantly detected (> 5 sigma) over the timescales of 1-day and 1-month prior to T0.\n\nWe searched for intermediate (days to years) timescale emission from a new gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the IC230217A best-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a point source at the IC230217A best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 4.5e-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~14-years (2008-08-04 to 2023-02-17 UTC), and < 1.9e-8 (<7.8e-7) ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month (1-day) integration time before T0.\n\nSince Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this region will continue. For these observations the Fermi-LAT contact persons are S. Garrappa (simone.garrappa at ruhr-uni-bochum.de), J. Sinapius (jonas.sinapius at desy.de) and S. Buson (sara.buson at uni-wuerzburg.de).\n\nThe Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV.

The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-230217A ranges from 1.6e-01 to 1.7e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window.\n\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

T90 (15-350 keV) is 1.30 +- 0.45 sec.\n(estimated error including systematics).  The T90 vs. hardness diagram shows\nthe burst well within the short-hard burst region.\n\nThe time-averaged spectrum from T-0.26 to T+1.75 sec is best fit by a simple\npower-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is\n0.99 +- 0.12.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.3 +- 0.2 x 10^-6 erg/cm2.\nThe 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-0.24 sec in the 15-150 keV band\nis 20.2 +- 1.5 ph/cm2/sec.

Leicester) report on behalf of the Stargate consortium:\n\nWe observed the field of the short GRB 230217A (Moss et al. GCN Circ. 33339) with the ESO/VLT equipped with the FORS2 instrument. \nA series of optical images has been obtained with the I filter on 2023 February 20 (i.e. about 2.5 days after the burst) and on 2023 \nFebruary 23 (i.e. about 5.5 days after the burst). \n\nImage subtraction carried out between the two epochs shows a residual at the following position:\nRA (J2000) = 18:43:04.97\nDec (J2000) = -28:50:16.4 \n\n+/- 0.3\". \n\nThis position lies inside the XRT error circle of the X-ray afterglow position (Capalbi et al., GCN Circ. 33365) and is consistent with the \nposition of the radio source reported by Schroeder et al. (GCN Circ. 33358). \n\nFrom preliminary photometry, we measure for this source a magnitude of I ~ 24.5 (AB) at t-t0 = 2.5 days.\n\nWe propose this source as a candidate optical counterpart of GRB 230217A. \n\nFurther observations are planned.\n\n\nWe acknowledge excellent support from the ESO observing staff in Paranal, in particular Julia Seidel, Konrad Tristram and Thomas Rivinius.",
